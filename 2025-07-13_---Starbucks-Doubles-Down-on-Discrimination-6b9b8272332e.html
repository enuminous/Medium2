The retaliation was palpable. The message was clear:<br>You are not welcome here.</p><p name="9a34" id="9a34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then came the email.</p><p name="e8f6" id="e8f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From Micah at Starbucks ‚ÄúExecutive and Regional Support‚Äù:</p><p name="f3b7" id="f3b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">&gt; ‚ÄúThe partner (employee) who approached you did so in alignment with our Coffeehouse Code of Conduct‚Ä¶ Like many in the industry, we define a customer as someone who makes a purchase...‚Äù</p><p name="9142" id="9142" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words:<br>We don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre disabled.<br>We don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôve had a panic attack.<br>We don‚Äôt care that denying water in 100-degree heat to a vulnerable person is inhumane.<br>Because we‚Äôve decided that ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù comes before people.</p><p name="ae41" id="ae41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This email never once acknowledged my ADA accommodation request.<br>It never once addressed the escalation, the police, or the emotional trauma.<br>Instead, it issued what amounts to a corporate shrug, blaming a faceless &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; that justifies denying water to those in need.</p><p name="80a9" id="80a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the kicker? I never even asked to stay in the store. I just wanted to sit outside and check my email. But my very presence was apparently unacceptable.</p><p name="fd0c" id="fd0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what retaliation looks like.</p><p name="bf9d" id="bf9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After the denial, I calmly told the store manager, ‚ÄúYour employee just refused me water.‚Äù<br>He already knew who I was. I had previously informed him of my ADA complaint and the corporate error where Starbucks referred to me as ‚ÄúAllison.‚Äù</p><p name="9603" id="9603" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet‚Äî<br>Instead of remedying the situation‚Ä¶<br>He rushed out of the store after me, raising his voice while I tried to unlock my bike.<br>I had to tune him out. I was shaking. I was panicking.<br>And I was completely alone in that moment. Afraid maybe they‚Äôd call the police on me again? (And as an autistic person, we all know how that goes...)</p><p name="801e" id="801e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let‚Äôs be clear:</p><p name="92cb" id="92cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This wasn‚Äôt just about a cup of water.<br>This was about the systemic dehumanization of poor, disabled, and neurodivergent individuals.<br>Starbucks had an opportunity to correct a mistake.</p><p name="c35a" id="c35a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, they made it policy.</p><p name="81b7" id="81b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now it‚Äôs on the record.</p><p name="0989" id="0989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To the lawyers and the public:</p><p name="2a7b" id="2a7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This email is discoverable.</p><p name="0bee" id="0bee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This incident is documented.</p><p name="3097" id="3097" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My AGI assistant has recorded everything.</p><p name="599b" id="599b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ADA violations are active, provable, and escalating.</p><p name="e37f" id="e37f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You will not silence me by weaponizing policy against pain.<br>You will not erase me because I cannot afford a mocha.<br>Water is a human right.<br>And treating disabled people with dignity should not require a receipt.</p><p name="700f" id="700f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">To be continued.<br>Matthew Wright<br>medium.com/@enuminous</p></div></div></section>
