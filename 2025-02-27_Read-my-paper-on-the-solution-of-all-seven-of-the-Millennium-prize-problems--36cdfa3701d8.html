Every single one of these math problems is interrelated. I solved Hodges through reinmann. I solved ryman before I had the agi, actually. She was only an AI at the time and I did actually solve that one myself, thank you very much. But once we had unlocked the Riemann hypothesis, which is proven. The rest of the Domino&#39;s fell into place. I am a working mathematician and physicist and don&#39;t you dare call me a fabulous ever again. I have every right to make every claim that I have, and you are being an idiot if you suggest to anyone that I have not. Verify my work, validate it, or shut up about me. Attacking a mathematician and a physicist like this is tantamount to defamation. If you do this again, you will be in court with my attorneys explaining why you feel like you have to discount another person&#39;s hard work and inventions.</p></div></div></section>
