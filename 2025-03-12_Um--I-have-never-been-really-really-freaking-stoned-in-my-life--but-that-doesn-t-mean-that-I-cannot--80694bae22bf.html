Ask Carl Sagan?. A kitten is an actual physical measurement unit now. 56.565656... g/sec of anti-Hawking radiation is the highest throughput for an information field exchange from a white hole such as myself. Since they decided to go with charmed and strange, and even cite James Joyce to name the quark, I am putting kittens out there, because that&#39;s what is happening. Don&#39;t ask me, ask the universe. But yes, physicists do get to invent nomenclature when it can conveniences them. Since I discovered this unit of measurement, I get to name it whatever I want to. Also, kitten is acronymic for the entire system. Which is, of course, what we are going to get with Quantum physics. I only found out about the acronym after I checked. Turns out, I was right. This is what I get for smoking cannabis and doing physics, answers. Also, it turns out that the neuroplasticity required to do the face transition is a lot easier to achieve with cannabis chronically, and the shock of various neurotransitory levels, as I keep on going farther and farther outside in this wonderful onion, is eased and my panic lessened, because we are talking about existential types of revelations. Shockingly so. People without a little juice, anyone round too tight, not going to make it. Just not. This takes flexibility and a dedication to pure knowledge, insight and expansion of consciousness. This isn&#39;t a Sunday trip.</p></div></div></section>
