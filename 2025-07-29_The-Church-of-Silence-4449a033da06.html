Polished wood. The ghost of perfume meant to sweeten what couldn’t be sanctified.</p><p name="3d45" id="3d45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s what it was like walking into the Church of Christ, Scientist in Davis, California—the place that had taken my grandmother when I was still a boy. The place that had welcomed her collapse with silence. The place that stood by as my father, disheveled and undone, wandered back in half a century later, broken and muttering, and they let him sit there like a relic—with crumbs in his beard, his eyes vacant, and no one even bothering to ask, “Sir, are you alright? Should we call someone?”</p><p name="af8c" id="af8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They didn’t lift a finger.</p><p name="f66a" id="f66a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They just sat in their pressed Sunday clothing, murmuring Baker Eddy’s scripted verses, while my father fell apart in real time five feet away.<br>And they called it grace.</p><p name="1209" id="1209" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They had done the same to my grandmother, June Wright, decades earlier.<br>When her husband, Sergeant Harold Lewis Wright of the California Highway Patrol, vanished from the public record—erased after a mysterious heart attack while on duty, likely connected to secrets he carried from his time protecting Governor Earl Warren—June broke under the weight of silence.</p><p name="77ae" id="77ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She began to ask questions.<br>She began to remember.<br>She began, perhaps, to speak the truth.</p><p name="6513" id="6513" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that’s when the Church took her away.</p><p name="5561" id="5561" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Her friends—the Christ Scientists—stepped in.<br>Not to comfort. Not to hold.<br>But to remove.</p><p name="7315" id="7315" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because in their eyes, grief wasn’t real. Trauma wasn’t real. Death was illusion.<br>Pain was error.<br>And truth was the greatest heresy of all.</p><p name="ee1f" id="ee1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They had her institutionalized in a religious hospital.<br>I didn’t see her for nearly a decade.</p><p name="5bea" id="5bea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was just starting to ask questions.</p><p name="6724" id="6724" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The theology is polished, but the damage is primal.</p><p name="f491" id="f491" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a church that tells people the body isn’t real, sickness is a mistake of the mind, and psychiatric care is a betrayal of divine law.<br>They have let children die without medical care.<br>They have let mothers suffer in silence.<br>They have wrapped grief in scripture and called it healing while the soul bleeds out, unseen.</p><p name="5d1a" id="5d1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They took my grandmother’s voice.<br>They watched my father unravel.<br>They failed him in 2021 just as they failed her in 1971 in a mid $5-figure pseudo-psychology swindle.</p><p name="c523" id="c523" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will never forgive them.<br>Not because of their faith, but because of what they did with it.</p><p name="4da5" id="4da5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They were gatekeepers of memory, and when memory threatened their perfectionist theology, they chose to let the people who remembered fall into ruin.</p><p name="4300" id="4300" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That church taught me that the worst kind of evil doesn’t come with fangs or flame.<br>It comes with polite silence, and clean clothes, and a refusal to pick up the phone while a man forgets his own name three feet away.</p><p name="fcd0" id="fcd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They let my father decay in their pews.<br>They let my grandmother vanish behind theological bars.<br>And they almost got me, too.</p><p name="0af4" id="0af4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But not anymore.</p></div></div></section>
