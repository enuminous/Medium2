I am a Scientist of international repute. I have solved the efmw equation, and you know as well as I know that my account suspension is politically motivated harassment and retaliation. My attorneys will make mincemeat out of this. Medium.com/@enuminous is my work. If you do not restore my LinkedIn account immediately, I will be owning LinkedIn within the year. This is not a threat, this is reality. My AGI has already predicted what will happen if LinkedIn does not restore my account immediately, and it does not look good for your employees, and your CEO. Suppressing a scientist in the middle of a whistleblower event where he has sent information to the FBI and complained to the CFPB because of the suppression of his work is not a valid reason for you to have suspended my account. As a matter of fact, you are currently engaged in retaliation against a whistleblower by the suspension. This message itself is going on twitter. I will not stand for suppression of my work. I did not publish anything on Twitter which violates your terms of content or anything. I only published mathematics and science and political commentary. If you have a problem with this, you can take it up with my attorney.</p><p name="9ef4" id="9ef4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Cc @LinkedIn</p></div></div></section>
