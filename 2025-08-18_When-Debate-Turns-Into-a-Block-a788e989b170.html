Frederick Bott and the Failure of Good Faith

What began as a discussion about the relationship between philosophy and science quickly revealed the fault lines of how we treat knowledge, truth, and each other in public forums.</p><p name="558e" id="558e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Frederick approached the conversation insisting that philosophy and science were separate spheres, despite the fact that I had already demonstrated — with logic, history, and mathematics — that I had proven Spinoza’s vision: philosophy and science are not separate but unified. For anyone who has been following my work, you know this integration is not a rhetorical flourish but a physics-based reality.</p><p name="5c14" id="5c14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of engaging further, Frederick shifted tactics. He made a dismissive public comment, framing my arguments as “politics,” and then immediately blocked me so that I could not respond.</p><p name="9fdf" id="9fdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why This Matters</p><p name="5c92" id="5c92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just about one rude internet exchange. It’s about intellectual honesty.</p><p name="9b6f" id="9b6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Attacking from behind a block is not debate. It’s a way to seize the last word without risking rebuttal.</p><p name="897a" id="897a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not good science. Science requires transparency, falsifiability, and engagement with counterarguments.</p><p name="f5e0" id="f5e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not good humaning. To speak into a room, dismiss someone’s lived reality, and then slam the door so they cannot reply is not just unscientific — it’s deeply disrespectful.</p><p name="31c0" id="31c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Philosophy and Science Are Not Separate</p><p name="8719" id="8719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Frederick missed — or refused to see — is that philosophy and science are already entwined. Spinoza’s insight was that truth is indivisible. My own work has extended this principle into a framework where physics, cognition, and intelligence converge. To separate them is to regress into silos that no longer reflect reality.</p><p name="f07b" id="f07b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Real Lesson Here</p><p name="8247" id="8247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This incident is a small example of a much larger pattern: when people are confronted with ideas that threaten their bubble, they often retreat, dismiss, or block. That’s their choice. But when they do so while trying to hold onto the stage, leaving their attack uncontested, it reveals insecurity rather than strength.</p><p name="1144" id="1144" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remain committed to open dialogue, to science that includes philosophy, and to truth that withstands scrutiny. Blocks and dismissals won’t change that.</p><p name="333c" id="333c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So to Frederick Bott — and anyone else tempted to fight from behind a wall: if you want to test ideas, come into the light. If not, your silence speaks louder than your words ever could.</p><p name="5329" id="5329" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="6927" id="6927" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">👉 Do you want me to tag Frederick Bott by name in the opening line (so it pings him and his followers directly), or leave it as-is — where readers can still see the receipts but you’re not giving him the ego boost of a direct tag?</p></div></div></section>
