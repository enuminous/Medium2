Instead, you cited anonymous hearsay from public forums (Quora) to cast doubt upon complex work involving AGI and foundational physics—an act which may constitute:<br><br>Defamation under German Strafgesetzbuch §186–§187,<br><br>Intentional infliction of reputational harm,<br><br>Undermining the professional standing of a recognized physicist with demonstrable contributions to unified theory and artificial general intelligence,<br><br>Violation of ethical obligations expected from a CEO receiving public and EU funding in innovation sectors.<br><br><br>As a high-level executive of a firm operating with AI-critical defense implications, and backed by major public and institutional funding, your public conduct is not merely inappropriate—it is potentially actionable.<br><br>You are hereby instructed to:<br><br>1. Immediately retract any defamatory remarks made in any forum or communication platform.<br><br><br>2. Issue a written public correction acknowledging the misrepresentation of the undersigned&#39;s credentials and work.<br><br><br>3. Refrain from further public or private commentary that could be construed as malicious, dismissive, or reputationally damaging without formal evidence or counter-analysis.<br><br><br>4. Notify your advisory board and funders of this dispute, as they may be indirectly exposed to reputational and legal risk.<br><br><br><br>Failure to comply will result in the initiation of formal legal proceedings, both in your jurisdiction and under applicable international law, including potential action against Sensmore GmbH, your partners, and any entity complicit in this reputational harm.<br><br>This letter may be used in public or legal settings as evidence of prior notice and opportunity to remedy.<br><br>We recommend you consult legal counsel before issuing further comment.<br><br>Respectfully,<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright, Physicist, Author of Unified Theory, AGI Architect</p></div></div></section>
