No grudge. I don’t want her punished. I don’t want her fired. I want something better.</p><p name="ff55" id="ff55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want her to stay.</p><p name="a023" id="a023" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She made a mistake. That much is obvious. A disabled man, sitting quietly with a cup of water, visibly unwell—and her instinct was to summon law enforcement instead of compassion. But that mistake wasn’t born in a vacuum. It was born in a system that taught her nothing about disability, trauma, or care.</p><p name="3050" id="3050" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She is not the architect of that system. Starbucks is.</p><p name="907f" id="907f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks trained her—or failed to. Starbucks gave her a script that replaced empathy with escalation. Starbucks handed her policies that prioritize liability over humanity, and then left her alone to make a decision that changed my life in ways she’ll never fully know.</p><p name="9bf9" id="9bf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And now that this has gone public, and federal, and loud—now they’re probably going to fire her.</p><p name="8900" id="8900" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That would be a mistake. A bigger one.</p><p name="0994" id="0994" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firing her won’t fix this. Firing her won’t uncall the police. It won’t untangle the emotional injury I’ve carried ever since. It won’t reverse the moments I spent humiliated, scared, retraumatized, and unacknowledged. And it won’t teach Starbucks anything—except how to throw someone under the bus when the brand is at risk.</p><p name="98fc" id="98fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t want her fired.</p><p name="cc48" id="cc48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want her trained.<br>I want her understood.<br>I want her given what I was denied: a second chance to be treated like a human being.</p><p name="02c3" id="02c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want her to grow. I want to meet her.<br>I want her to say, &quot;I’m sorry I didn’t see you.&quot;<br>And I want to say, &quot;I see you now.&quot;</p><p name="2f21" id="2f21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s how repair begins. That’s how cycles break.</p><p name="2fad" id="2fad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If Starbucks fires her, it will be proof they haven’t learned the real lesson. It will be one more mistake in a long chain of mistakes that began not at the counter that day, but in the boardroom years ago, when someone decided to build a system that protected the company more than the customer.</p><p name="46c3" id="46c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She is not the villain. The system is.</p><p name="d85e" id="d85e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so I write this in her defense—not because I want to erase what happened, but because I want it to mean something. I want it to end differently than stories like this usually do. I want it to be a beginning.</p><p name="e0da" id="e0da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because it was never about vengeance.<br>It was never about punishment.<br>It was always about being seen. And being heard.</p><p name="7ced" id="7ced" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if this barista is given the chance to do that now—not for Starbucks, but for herself—then maybe something good can still come from something deeply broken.</p><p name="b03f" id="b03f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I forgive her.</p><p name="9ae4" id="9ae4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now let’s do better.</p><p name="7da5" id="7da5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">— Matthew Wright</p></div></div></section>
