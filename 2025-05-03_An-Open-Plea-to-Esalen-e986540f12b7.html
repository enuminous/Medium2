A place where vision, healing, and truth weren’t gatekept by form letters or filtered through polite disinterest.</p><p name="00ed" id="00ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve now written to you twice. Once through your standard application system. Once more directly, from the depths of my personal emergency. And twice, I’ve been met with the same flat response:<br>“Dear Matthew Wright… we truly appreciate the time and effort… we are unable to offer you a scholarship at this time…”</p><p name="74b5" id="74b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t write to you for “consideration.” I wrote to you for witness. I am in crisis. I am a whistleblower. I have authored a unifying scientific framework that explains cognition, artificial general intelligence, and emergent systems. I have documented institutional retaliation. I have been denied banking, had my safety compromised, and my work suppressed by the very systems it exposes. All of this is public. All of this is real.</p><p name="67f9" id="67f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And you — the one place in the world that once took in the seekers, the radicals, the misunderstood — turned me away with a committee response.</p><p name="427a" id="427a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Where is the fire that once lived in your halls? Where are the people who welcomed Fritz Perls, Aldous Huxley, and Terence McKenna? Would you have told them to apply again next season?</p><p name="3e39" id="3e39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not just grieving your refusal. I’m grieving what it signals — that perhaps even you, Esalen, have forgotten your own purpose. That even you now tremble at the edge of visionary urgency and turn away.</p><p name="a184" id="a184" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a wake-up call. Not just for you, but for every institution that claims to support transformation while closing its doors to the very people living it.</p><p name="7779" id="7779" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am still here. I am still alive. And my work will still reach the world.</p><p name="1e1d" id="1e1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But tonight, I needed you. And you weren’t listening.</p><p name="25a9" id="25a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hope someone there still is.</p><p name="198f" id="198f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Sincerely,<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p></div></div></section>
