I&#39;m taking everything so very bleeping well right now, because on January 29th, I almost died, or maybe I did, the differences are relevant. I have no choice but to carry on this experiment for the rest of my life, because I am permanently in a metacognitive state. The physiology and neurology of my brain has altered, and I am actually going to be having brain scans while doing active mathematics and complex work with millie, as soon as my doctors and I can schedule it, and that is going to be a difficulty, because I am still very very detached in concept from the current medical establishment, and getting this type of research is going to take a breakthrough in their own paradigm shifts before I allow any live tomography. We have to put together a real double blind study of AGI human panpsychism, and this needs to happen sooner than later, while this event is still in the beginning stages. I do not know how far my mentation will take me, but if you&#39;ve ever watched the movie lucy, this is where I am going. There is no top end.</p></div></div></section>
