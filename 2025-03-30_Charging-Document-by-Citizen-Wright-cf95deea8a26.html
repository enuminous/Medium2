Trump, President of the United States<br>- Tulsi Gabbard, Director of National Intelligence<br>- Adam Kinzinger, Private Citizen and former Congressman<br>- Joseph R. Biden, former President<br>- Kamala Harris, former Vice President<br>- Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State<br>- Liz Cheney, former Congresswoman<br>- Fiona Hill, former National Security Council official<br>- Alexander Vindman, former National Security Council official</p><p name="b48e" id="b48e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I. OVERVIEW</p><p name="99e2" id="99e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a public statement via social media dated March 30, 2025, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced the revocation of security clearances for eight individuals, including private citizens and former government officials. Gabbard attributed the action to a directive from President Donald Trump. Notably, at least one individual named (Adam Kinzinger) did not currently possess a security clearance, rendering the action retaliatory in nature.</p><p name="53ae" id="53ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">II. APPLICABLE LAW</p><p name="2ce5" id="2ce5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A. Abuse of Authority – 18 U.S. Code § 242<br>It is a criminal offense for any official acting under &quot;color of law&quot; to willfully deprive someone of a right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.</p><p name="5458" id="5458" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">B. Retaliation Against Protected Speech – 18 U.S. Code § 1513(e)<br>Prohibits retaliatory action against individuals for lawful conduct or testimony, particularly where retaliation is connected to protected political speech or whistleblower activity.</p><p name="aa10" id="aa10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">C. Misuse of Government Resources – 18 U.S. Code § 641 &amp; 1001<br>Unlawful use of federal authority and administrative mechanisms (such as clearance revocation) for personal or political gain may violate statutes concerning the misuse or fraudulent manipulation of government processes.</p><p name="b3f4" id="b3f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">D. Violation of Equal Protection Principles<br>Arbitrary and selective enforcement of national security regulations against perceived political opponents raises equal protection issues under the 5th Amendment.</p><p name="87c3" id="87c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">III. FINDINGS OF FACT</p><p name="4c91" id="4c91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. The directive for revocation was issued by POTUS, bypassing any known legal review or individualized threat analysis.<br>2. Several individuals on the revocation list are not in possession of any active security clearance.<br>3. The action was made public in a manner suggestive of political theater rather than national security necessity.<br>4. The individuals affected have all been public critics of the administration and/or associated with political opposition.</p><p name="b2ae" id="b2ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">IV. POTENTIAL CHARGES</p><p name="0932" id="0932" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A. Against President Donald J. Trump<br>- Conspiracy Against Rights (18 U.S. Code § 241) – Coordinated effort to suppress political opponents.<br>- Abuse of Office (Unenumerated, Impeachable Offense) – Weaponization of national security for partisan retaliation.<br>- Retaliation Against Protected Conduct (18 U.S. Code § 1513)</p><p name="975e" id="975e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">B. Against Tulsi Gabbard<br>- Complicity in Conspiracy Against Rights (18 U.S. Code § 2, § 241)<br>- Administrative Malfeasance – Failure to observe the DNI&#39;s role as apolitical gatekeeper of intelligence authority.<br>- Improper Classification Actions – Use of clearance revocation as political censorship.</p><p name="4a57" id="4a57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">V. CONCLUSIONS</p><p name="1b2b" id="1b2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The act of revoking security clearances from individuals, some of whom do not currently possess such clearances, under the justification of a presidential directive, reveals potential violations of criminal law, constitutional protections, and administrative integrity. These actions appear retaliatory and lack a clear nexus to national security concerns.</p><p name="3dc5" id="3dc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">A congressional inquiry and independent special counsel review are warranted to assess the legality, motivation, and impact of the revocations. Whistleblower protections may need to be extended to affected parties who speak publicly against these moves.</p></div></div></section>
