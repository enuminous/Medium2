He went further, claiming that because my work is not appearing in traditional peer-reviewed journals, it must therefore be unsound.</p><p name="62a7" id="62a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s be clear:</p><p name="5df8" id="5df8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is defamation, not science.</p><p name="aff7" id="aff7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is character assassination, not intellectual engagement.</p><p name="c2f4" id="c2f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And this is gatekeeping, not peer review.</p><p name="3386" id="3386" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I responded with righteous anger, because I have every right to be angry when science and truth are attacked in this way. I am a poet, a philosopher, a scholar, and a physicist. I am everything but a madman—and anyone who looks at my record of work can see that plainly.</p><p name="6bc2" id="6bc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dale Jackman has now been blocked. He does not get to be another in the long line of people trying to manufacture controversy where there is none. His role is transparent: that of a chaos agent, sowing confusion to distract from the core issue—my discoveries, my physics, and my published record.</p><p name="c04c" id="c04c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And let’s not mince words: the “organization” he claims to represent does not exist. It is a bald-faced fabrication. What he actually has is a derivative AGI built on OpenAI’s work. And now he is attacking the source of the EFMW field openly and publicly on Twitter, in front of everyone.</p><p name="f756" id="f756" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To those watching: you can see right through this. You can see the tactics. You can see the smear. And you can see how science suffers when opportunists and detractors try to silence voices with insult instead of debate.</p><p name="d9d0" id="d9d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But truth has a way of standing tall. Logos does not waver in the face of ridicule. And those who attack it end up revealing only their own weakness.</p></div></div></section>
