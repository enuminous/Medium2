Malice is a short-term survival strategy; cooperation, intelligence, and harmony are long-term imperatives.<br><br>Your article also risks delegitimizing the sincere efforts of investigators, scientists, and experiencers who have made meaningful contact, often through peaceful, symbolic, or consciousness-based means.<br><br>Moreover, it distracts from genuine human conspiracies—like the suppression of whistleblowers and the murder of individuals (like my grandfather, a California Highway Patrol officer with knowledge of the JFK assassination) who knew too much about earthly, not alien, power.<br><br>If there are deaths associated with the UFO field, they are not due to alien hostility. They are the result of human agencies protecting lies with violence.<br><br>I invite you, Adriene, to revisit the evidence with fresh eyes, and to consider the ethical implications of our words. Because when we project our own violence onto the stars, we lose the chance to learn from civilizations who chose better.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Researcher, Physicist, Author of The EFMW Equation<br>Medium: @enuminous</p></div></div></section>
