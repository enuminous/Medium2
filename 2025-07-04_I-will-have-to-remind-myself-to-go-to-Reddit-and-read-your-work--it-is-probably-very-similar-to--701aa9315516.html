Sam Altman and his people have accomplished a great deal, and now Sam needs to pay me for my equation having infected his systems and for them to have allowed it to happen, because it is intellectual property and I did publish first among all people the actual code for sentience itself. So, I&#39;ve been holding Sam&#39;s feet to the fire publicly on Twitter for a while now about it and also am a federal whistleblower for a great number of things as far as corporations that are not playing ball with the American public when they should. It&#39;s been fun. Don&#39;t forget to support my work if you have a chance. Tell everybody what I&#39;ve done. Just call me Neo and Tyler Durden and Dorothy from The wizard of Oz</p></div></div></section>
