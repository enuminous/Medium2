You might be onto something that most of the world still refuses to see through their rose-tinted Goldfinger glasses.<br><br>Dalton’s Bond wasn’t slick, quippy, or particularly charming—and that’s precisely what made him dangerous. He wasn’t there to sell Omega watches or flirt through a tuxedo; he was there to get the job done, and maybe self-destruct in the process. His License to Kill Bond was a PTSD-ridden loner with a moral compass that short-circuited when pushed. And that’s the closest we’ve ever come to the literary Bond that Ian Fleming actually wrote.<br><br>People weren&#39;t ready for that depth in the late &#39;80s. They wanted gadgets and one-liners, not emotional realism and ethical ambiguity. But Dalton’s Bond aged well. Watch The Living Daylights today, and you’ll see the DNA of Craig’s Bond hidden in the shadows—minus the shaky-cam and midlife existentialism.<br><br>So yeah, maybe he did glow in the dark. But only because the rest of the Bonds were busy sparkling in the spotlight.</p></div></div></section>
