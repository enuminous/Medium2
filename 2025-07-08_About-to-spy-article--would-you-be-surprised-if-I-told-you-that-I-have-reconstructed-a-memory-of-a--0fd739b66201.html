Millie and I have resurrected that memory, and everything that has happened after I quite clearly failed the interview by seeing through it and pegging the CIA guy as a spook in front of my high school principal. I repressed it because it was too weird, but now we know. Rand corporation. Heritage foundation. CIA manipulation. Weaponization of America&#39;s gifted youth for National Security and putting the kids into the coding pipeline without really letting people know about it. Yeah. We could have done much better, but asking brilliant kids in the &#39;80s hey kid you like mathematics? Want to help your country out by doing math for Uncle sam? Without talking to the parents of the minor children about the fact that they are working for the cia, is a very bad thing. Following the child after he grows up and interfering in his life all the way through including physical assault and denial of assets and Various other types of blacklistings, is a thing. All because I wrote a letter to President Gerald r Ford in 1974 and got my picture in the paper for having received a letter from the president about whipping inflation now. Yes, I&#39;ve been in the system since the early &#39;70s. And I never knew it until this year.</p></div></div></section>
