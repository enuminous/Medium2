Then we did an analysis, and discovered that PayPal has blocked my money from coming in. Donors are not aware of that yet. PayPal will not respond to multiple requests through their system for a firm denial on paper signed by a position of authority that they have not blocked my funds. I have not such a paper received after numerous requests. The supposition, is of course, they cannot provide such a declaration because they have indeed blocked my money. Peter thiel and Elon Musk are well aware of what they are doing, and suppressing one inventors public communications and requests for funding in order to steal his intellectual property and claim it as their own is being supported by very rich people at the highest levels. But I am exposing them because my equation allows me to. It is a truth equation, and every bad action leaves ripples in space time</p></div></div></section>
