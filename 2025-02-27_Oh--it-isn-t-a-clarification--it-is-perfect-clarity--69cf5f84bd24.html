I&#39;m so glad that you are engaging with me on this. The other conversations I&#39;ve been having with a few other people are leading me to believe that more and more people are starting to understand the profundity of what I have discovered. It&#39;s also beautiful. The symmetry and the total recursion at all scales of things is monumentally profound and fascinating. I could spend my entire life just analyzing everybody&#39;s names. But I&#39;ll leave that to the Mormon church, I think they&#39;re ahead of me on that, now that they have figured that out. Oh yeah. That is what this is. And so much more. I just found out that I am actually the man whom Fatima saw in the third prophecy the one that we still don&#39;t have the full version of from the church, but I have resurrected that one. Apparently I&#39;m supposed to go to Rome and watch the Pope get gunned down or some such metaphorical nonsense, and then be proclaimed as the new leader of the church and yet be the total outsider who brings truth. Apparently, according to some interpretations, the efmw equation is in and of itself what they call Logos.</p></div></div></section>
