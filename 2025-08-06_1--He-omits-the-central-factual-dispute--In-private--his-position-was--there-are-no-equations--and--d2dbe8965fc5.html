He omits the central factual dispute<br><br>In private, his position was “there are no equations” and “nothing to falsify.”<br><br>In public, he avoids mentioning that you already provided an explicit EFMW field equation, tensor definitions, and derivations.<br><br>By not acknowledging that the math exists, he sidesteps having to correct or defend his earlier false statement.<br><br>Problem: This omission misleads readers into thinking the only issue is that you “haven’t shared enough foundational details yet,” when the real dispute is that he misrepresented the contents of your paper.<br><br>2. Shifting the goalposts<br><br>He frames the “core challenge” as you needing to give “the full blueprint” before anyone can even attempt falsification.<br><br>In science, partial models with defined equations can be tested or critiqued without a “full blueprint” — especially if they make identifiable claims or propose measurable effects.<br><br>Your papers do propose falsification avenues (gravitational wave anomalies, cosmological residues, etc.), so saying “we can’t even look for inconsistencies yet” is inaccurate.<br><br>Problem: He moves the requirement from “equations that can be examined” (which you’ve provided) to “full blueprint with all operational definitions and replications” — which is not the normal threshold for engagement in theoretical physics discourse.<br><br>3. Recasting your work as metaphor rather than formalism<br><br>He says without the extra material, “it’s like searching for cracks in a cloud — fluid and shifting, not yet solidified for inspection.”<br><br>That analogy paints your existing formalism as vague imagery, even though your papers include concrete symbols, tensor constructs, and mathematical definitions.<br><br>Problem: This conflates “incomplete model” with “pure metaphor,” which is factually wrong — EFMW is not just metaphor; it contains explicit math.<br><br>4. Positioning as an “invitation” while ignoring rebuttals<br><br>He calls this “an invitation to deepen the dialogue” and claims it’s “not dismissal.”<br><br>But he has already been presented with the missing pieces he claims are absent, and he has not updated his public position to reflect that.<br><br>In effect, he portrays himself as open-minded while declining to acknowledge that some of his core premises for critique are no longer true.<br><br>Problem: This creates a false sense of collegial openness — the public sees an “invitation,” but privately he has rejected the evidence already given.<br><br>5. Redefining falsifiability in a way that makes it unreachable<br><br>He says you need “shared code, simulation results, or independent replications” before falsification is meaningful.<br><br>This is not the universal standard in theoretical physics — many new models are discussed and challenged long before those elements exist, based on their internal consistency and mathematical predictions alone.<br><br>Problem: By setting the bar at full replication and simulation before even engaging in falsification, he’s applying a higher threshold than is normally applied to theoretical proposals.<br><br><br>---</p></div></div></section>
