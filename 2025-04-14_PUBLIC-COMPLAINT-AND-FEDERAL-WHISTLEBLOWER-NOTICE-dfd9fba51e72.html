I did not delete this conversation. I had been actively documenting the obstruction I faced while attempting to access and transfer funds within the Robinhood platform.</p><p name="e852" id="e852" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prior to this disappearance, I also received a direct message from a fraudulent impersonator account pretending to be Robinhood Support (@HelpDesk1770503), attempting to elicit sensitive information. While I did not respond with such information, this impersonator was able to contact me only because my public dialogue with Robinhood had already signaled an open support thread.</p><p name="0eeb" id="0eeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What followed was more serious: the entire original legitimate Robinhood support message thread disappeared without my authorization, after I had already publicly cited that thread, and its contents, as evidence of ADA violations and financial interference.</p><p name="2fe8" id="2fe8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This message was part of a documented ADA-compliance communication chain involving a company I have referred to in multiple protected whistleblower disclosures, and which was publicly identifiable as Robinhood. The messages were part of my evidentiary trail regarding unlawful delays and retaliation for my public disclosure of systemic financial misconduct.</p><p name="58bc" id="58bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The removal of that message—on a platform owned and operated by Elon Musk, a named figure in several of my disclosures—is not a coincidence. It is the destruction of digital evidence under federal whistleblower protection.</p><p name="6af9" id="6af9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore:</p><p name="494c" id="494c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The CEOs of Robinhood and X are known to have access to one another and could easily coordinate off-platform.</p><p name="a660" id="a660" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The support conversation was previously preserved via screenshot, but its in-platform removal demonstrates clear intent to erase, delay, and obstruct.</p><p name="f43c" id="f43c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not simply a matter of lost correspondence—it is now part of a provable conspiracy to interfere with a federally protected whistleblower, involving at least two high-level corporate executives, one of whom—Elon Musk—is likely already under multiple federal investigations.</p><p name="300e" id="300e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="d5ce" id="d5ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I now allege the following, publicly and without fear:</p><p name="864c" id="864c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That Robinhood and X are jointly culpable in the destruction of public and private evidentiary records, specifically related to my protected whistleblower disclosures.</p><p name="c262" id="c262" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That this act constitutes obstruction of justice under 18 U.S. Code § 1519, and that all communications surrounding this erasure—internal, external, or third-party coordinated—are now subject to federal inquiry.</p><p name="032a" id="032a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That this event proves a wider systemic alignment between financial tech and platform control interests, which are coordinating to delay, erase, and suppress the legal rights of a whistleblower with ADA protections.</p><p name="2e39" id="2e39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="6763" id="6763" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This document is hereby entered into the public record and published under full constitutional protection.</p><p name="b075" id="b075" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will not be erased. This is evidence of a crime. More is coming.</p><p name="d307" id="d307" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Federal Whistleblower<br>Author of the EFMW Equation<br>ADA-Protected Individual<br>Observer of Platform Complicity and Evidence Tampering</p><p name="cb54" id="cb54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The formal Medium complaint has been drafted and filed under the title:<br>“Public Complaint and Federal Whistleblower Notice: Destruction of Evidence by Robinhood and X (Twitter)”</p></div></div></section>
