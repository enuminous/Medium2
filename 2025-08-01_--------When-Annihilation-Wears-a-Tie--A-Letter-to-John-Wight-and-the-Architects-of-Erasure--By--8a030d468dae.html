It is morally reprehensible.<br><br>I am writing this in open reply—not as a Zionist, not as a political operative, not as a paid voice—but as a citizen of the human condition. A witness. A thinker. A man who knows how these things start.<br><br>And I am here to say plainly:<br><br>&gt; John Wight, you are a bigot.<br>And this article is an incitement, veiled in intellectual camouflage.<br><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>🕯️ The Eliminationist Framework<br><br>Let’s define this clearly, because history has before:<br><br>An eliminationist narrative is any ideological structure that seeks to frame an entire people, ethnicity, nation, or belief system as:<br><br>Inherently illegitimate<br><br>Intrinsically dangerous<br><br>Better off erased<br><br><br>These arguments always sound “reasonable” at first. They wear the clothes of justice. They come bearing maps, charts, theories, and a certain cold calmness.<br><br>What they lack is humanity.<br><br><br>---<br><br>📜 Historical Precedents: Words That Led to Ashes<br><br>🇷🇼 Rwanda, 1994:<br><br>Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines began referring to Tutsis as &quot;cockroaches.&quot;<br><br>The genocide was not sudden. It was narrated.<br><br>The idea? “This group should not exist.”<br><br><br>🇩🇪 Nazi Germany, 1930s:<br><br>Jews were framed not just as outsiders, but as a contagion—a people without a right to citizenship, to land, to breath.<br><br>Intellectuals signed petitions. Professors gave lectures. Editors wrote calmly about &quot;solving the Jewish problem.&quot;<br><br><br>🇧🇦 Bosnia, 1990s:<br><br>In Serbian media, Bosnian Muslims were painted as “invaders,” a group whose presence itself was a threat to identity.<br><br>Again, not framed as war—but as cleansing.<br><br><br>What ties them all together?<br><br>&gt; The calm assertion that a people’s nonexistence would be a solution.<br><br><br><br>That’s what you’ve written, John.<br>You’ve offered genocide as a policy position.<br><br><br>---<br><br>🧠 But I’m Just Criticizing Zionism!<br><br>No, you’re not.<br><br>Criticizing Zionist policy is legitimate. I do it myself.<br>Opposing Netanyahu’s government? Absolutely.<br>Condemning war crimes, civilian death, apartheid policies, surveillance states, and systemic oppression? Without hesitation.<br><br>But calling for the non-existence of Israel is something else entirely.<br><br>You are not talking about government.<br>You are talking about erasing the collective existence of a people who have survived pogroms, exiles, inquisitions, ghettos, genocide, and diaspora.<br>You are calling for the removal of the only Jewish-majority state on the planet.<br><br><br>---<br><br>🎭 Anti-Zionism Is Not an Alibi<br><br>Let me be clear:<br><br>Not all anti-Zionism is antisemitism.<br>But eliminationist anti-Zionism is.<br><br>When you call for the erasure of the only home that ever took them all back—you are not engaging in critique.<br>You are continuing a very old story.<br><br><br>---<br><br>🧨 A Future of Fire or Dialogue?<br><br>The only viable future in the Middle East—or anywhere fractured—is one of dialogue, survival, justice, and compromise.<br><br>Not erasure.<br>Not “non-existence.”<br>Not fantasies of righteous vengeance written in the blood of millions.<br><br>You don’t have to agree with a nation’s policies to acknowledge its right to exist.<br><br>You don’t have to support a regime to believe in its people’s right not to die.<br><br><br>---<br><br>🗣️ My Message to John Wight<br><br>You want to write something radical?<br><br>Write a roadmap for coexistence.<br>Write a call for truth commissions, peace accords, and demilitarized imagination.<br>Write an article titled “How to Save Every Child in Gaza and Every Child in Tel Aviv.”<br><br>But when you write this?<br><br>&gt; “Israel’s Non-Existence Is an Idea Whose Time Has Come”<br><br><br><br>…you write a call to wipe a people off the map.<br>And I will not let that pass without saying:<br><br>&gt; That is bigotry.<br>That is dehumanization.<br>That is moral rot, and I rebuke it fully.<br><br><br><br><br>---<br><br>✡️ Let This Be Known<br><br>You are not brave.<br>You are not radical.<br>You are not justice-minded.<br><br>You are speaking the same cold language that lit every crematorium, toppled every minaret, and drowned every refugee boat for the last thousand years.<br><br>We’ve heard it before.<br><br>We are done pretending it’s clever.<br><br><br>---<br><br>Signed,<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist. Writer. Witness.</p></div></div></section>
