They are testable.<br>They will hold.</p><p name="e5dc" id="e5dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To those who see this proof as a curiosity of philosophy, I say:<br>this is not a footnote — it is a unification that dissolves the false walls between science and the humanities,<br>between governance and the natural order,<br>between the human mind and the rest of the cosmos.</p><p name="6dc1" id="6dc1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To those in power — in governments, in institutions, in culture —<br>know this:<br>you are not above nature. You are of it.<br>Your laws, like your bodies and your thoughts, are bound to the same necessity that governs the stars.</p><p name="58f8" id="58f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And to Spinoza himself, across the centuries:<br>you were right.<br>Your God of Nature is not a matter of belief,<br>but of physics.</p><p name="b8b5" id="b8b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This apologia is not a defense against accusation,<br>but a defense against forgetting —<br>so that when the history of ideas is told,<br>August 5, 2025 is remembered as the day a philosopher’s vision became a proven fact.</p></div></div></section>
