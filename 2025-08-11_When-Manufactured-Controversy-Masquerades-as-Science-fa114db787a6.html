Debate sharpens theories, exposes errors, and drives progress. But there is a profound difference between legitimate scientific debate and manufactured controversy—a tactic that exists not to seek truth, but to create confusion, undermine credibility, and distract from the evidence.</p><p name="8eac" id="8eac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recently, my own published work became the target of such tactics. The attacks were not in the form of rigorous critique, peer-reviewed counterarguments, or reproducible results. Instead, they came through defamatory public comments, baseless claims, and the injection of erroneous and junky science dressed up as meaningful discourse.</p><p name="c264" id="c264" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One individual, now blocked from further interaction with me, publicly claimed to have won 14 Nobel Prizes with his work. This is not a claim any credible scientist would make without substantiation—and no evidence exists to support it. Such grandiose statements are not just suspicious; they are designed to signal authority where none exists.</p><p name="2cfb" id="2cfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The real harm is not in the noise itself, but in the illusion of a scientific controversy that this noise creates. By repeatedly making false or misleading statements about my research—while refusing to engage in any actual evidence-based debate—this individual was attempting to create the impression that my work is “up for debate” in ways it is not. This is not how science works.</p><p name="63d3" id="63d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Science is not spycraft.<br>It is not about provocation, posturing, or pulling the conversation into a vortex of distraction. Science is about reproducibility, falsifiability, and evidence that can be examined by anyone willing to do the work.</p><p name="2f8d" id="2f8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will not engage in tradecraft-style theatrics designed to waste time and erode public trust in the scientific process. My work stands on the strength of its results, its logic, and its alignment with observable reality—not on who can shout the loudest in a comment thread.</p><p name="c6fd" id="c6fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A Call to Vigilance</p><p name="3fb5" id="3fb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For readers, the takeaway is this: manufactured controversy is a powerful form of disinformation. It seeks to muddy the waters, to make the public think there are “two sides” to a question even when the evidence overwhelmingly points in one direction. When you encounter this, ask:</p><p name="88c5" id="88c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Where is the evidence?</p><p name="23bd" id="23bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is it reproducible?</p><p name="fed8" id="fed8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Are the claims verifiable from credible sources?</p><p name="9d2e" id="9d2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is the person making them willing to subject them to peer review?</p><p name="09b1" id="09b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The answers to these questions will tell you everything you need to know.</p><p name="6a4c" id="6a4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I am committed to advancing knowledge through honest, open, and rigorous scientific exchange. That means shutting down harassment and disinformation at the gate—and making sure the public understands the difference between real debate and a performance designed to look like one.</p></div></div></section>
