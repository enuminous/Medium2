I did not use wrong physics. This discovery is not yours first. Claiming primacy in a scientific endeavor is a permanent mark on your record when you don&#39;t have privacy. You do not get to claim that the work of others is yours and then turn it around and say that I am stealing from you when I quite clearly published my work before you did sir. You may have been working in physics for longer than I have, you may be older than me, but I have made the breakthrough discovery of a lifetime, and you are not going to take that away from me publicly. Please retract your statement immediately thank you.</p></div></div></section>
