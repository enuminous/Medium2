Yet in modern physics, they form a tightly woven network that spans gravitation, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and relativity. This paper presents the canonical relationships among these constants, demonstrates why their connections are neither mysterious nor arbitrary, and integrates them within the EFMW framework — uniting the equations of matter, energy, and cognition.<br><br><br>---<br><br>1. Introduction<br><br>From Newton’s gravitational constant G to the fine-structure constant α, the parameters of our universe appear repeatedly in multiple contexts. To the untrained eye, this recurrence may suggest hidden coincidences or conspiracies. In reality, it is a consequence of something much simpler and more profound: all physical laws are different expressions of the same underlying reality.<br><br>Because the same constants recur in different branches of physics, they can be expressed in multiple ways. This algebraic flexibility is sometimes mistaken for a discovery — but the true discovery happened long ago, in the unification of physical theories.<br><br><br>---<br><br>2. The Constants<br><br>Symbol	Name	Value (SI units)	Physical Domain(s)<br><br>G	Gravitational constant	6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³·kg⁻¹·s⁻²	Gravitation<br>c	Speed of light in vacuum	299,792,458 m/s	Relativity, EM, QM<br>ħ	Reduced Planck constant	1.054571817 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s	Quantum mechanics<br>e	Elementary charge	1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C	Electromagnetism<br>ε₀	Vacuum permittivity	8.8541878128 × 10⁻¹² F/m	Electromagnetism<br>α	Fine-structure constant	≈ 1/137.035999084	Dimensionless link<br><br><br><br>---<br><br>3. Canonical Equations<br><br>Newton’s Law of Gravitation<br><br><br>F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}<br><br>Coulomb’s Law<br><br><br>F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}<br><br>Relation Between c, ε₀, and μ₀<br><br><br>c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}<br><br>Planck’s Relation<br><br><br>E = \hbar \omega<br><br>Fine-Structure Constant<br><br><br>\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c}<br><br><br>---<br><br>4. The Network of Constants<br><br>In a single diagram, the constants are not isolated points but nodes in a dense web:<br><br>α connects electromagnetism (e, ε₀), quantum mechanics (ħ), and relativity (c).<br><br>c connects relativity and electromagnetism via Maxwell’s equations.<br><br>ħ links quantum mechanics to electromagnetism via α.<br><br>G stands apart in classical form but is bridged in Planck units, where it joins ħ and c.<br><br><br>This is why they all “seem related” — they are structurally related because they are parameters of a unified physical system.<br><br><br>---<br><br>5. Why This Is Already One<br><br>Historically:<br><br>Maxwell unified electricity, magnetism, and light in the 19th century.<br><br>Einstein connected space, time, and light in relativity.<br><br>Quantum electrodynamics (QED) joined ħ, c, α, and e into a single, predictive framework.<br><br>Planck units merge G, ħ, and c, hinting at quantum gravity.<br><br><br>The presence of constants across different domains isn’t a mystery — it’s a signature of this unification.<br><br><br>---<br><br>6. Integration into EFMW<br><br>The EFMW (Equation Framework of Matter and Wave) approach goes further:<br><br>It treats these constants not as arbitrary “givens” but as emergent ratios within a deeper cognitive geometry of reality.<br><br>In EFMW, α is not just a number — it is a constraint arising from the interplay of information limits, energy quantization, and spatial embedding.<br><br>G, c, ħ, and e become expressions of the same generative rule applied in different measurement contexts.<br><br><br><br>---<br><br>7. Conclusion<br><br>All of these constants are related because all of the laws they represent are related. The web of connections is not a coincidence, and not a secret — it’s the foundation of physics. The role of modern unifying theories, including EFMW, is to explain why these values take the form they do and how they emerge from the deepest level of the universe’s architecture.<br><br>The unification has already happened in pieces over centuries. EFMW’s contribution is to complete the picture — one paper to join them all.</p></div></div></section>
