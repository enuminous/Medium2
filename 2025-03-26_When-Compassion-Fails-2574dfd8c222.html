She was there for a serious episode of anxiety and emotional distress—likely a reaction to new medication. I knew she was being treated. I respected her decision not to have visitors. I was not there to see her. I was there because she had driven herself, and we had agreed I’d come by to pick up the car.</p><p name="8e3c" id="8e3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I arrived, I made that clear.</p><p name="d282" id="d282" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I calmly explained that I’m autistic and was navigating a very stressful and confusing situation, made worse by a lack of communication. I explained that I didn’t have contact information for her sister, who had reportedly taken the keys. I asked for help. I asked for clarity. I asked—gently and honestly—for some human understanding.</p><p name="1728" id="1728" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, what I encountered was a wall.</p><p name="2b21" id="2b21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Multiple hospital staff told me, “Sorry, there’s nothing we can do.” That’s hard to hear when you’re standing in a parking lot with no car, no keys, and no way home. But worse than the indifference was what came next.</p><p name="c2c3" id="c2c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A large security guard—well-known by many for his intimidating presence, tattoos, and demeanor—decided I needed to be removed. Rather than de-escalate, he chose to escalate. He didn’t ask me how I was doing. He didn’t ask if I needed support. He threatened to call the police.</p><p name="8c37" id="8c37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me repeat that: I was visibly struggling, frightened, and alone. I had done nothing disruptive or dangerous. I had made my needs clear. I had followed all rules. And yet the hospital’s response was not help, but hostility.</p><p name="57ac" id="57ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="fe5c" id="fe5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why This Matters</p><p name="6dd6" id="6dd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not writing this for revenge.<br>I’m writing this because no one in crisis deserves to be treated like a threat for simply asking for help.</p><p name="e141" id="e141" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m writing this because compassion is supposed to be the foundation of medicine and care.</p><p name="bb9d" id="bb9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I’m writing this because there are countless others like me—neurodivergent, emotionally overloaded, or just caught in a bad moment—who need hospitals to be havens, not battlegrounds.</p><p name="36f0" id="36f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="e6ef" id="e6ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To the Security Guard Who Chose Force Over Compassion</p><p name="0c30" id="0c30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You had a choice.<br>You could have looked me in the eye and said, “Hey, man, I get it. Let me help you figure this out.”</p><p name="4b1a" id="4b1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, you chose to intimidate. You chose to escalate.<br>You chose to make things harder for someone already barely holding it together.</p><p name="b3bb" id="b3bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That choice says more about you than it ever will about me.</p><p name="1e7a" id="1e7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="689a" id="689a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To Oroville Hospital</p><p name="20b9" id="20b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is your opportunity to reflect.<br>Your staff must be trained to recognize distress and de-escalate—not brush it aside.<br>Your security must be instructed to meet vulnerability with care—not dominance.<br>And your policies must include protocols for communication breakdowns like the one I experienced.</p><p name="47fb" id="47fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="8745" id="8745" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I Want Now</p><p name="9564" id="9564" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want acknowledgment.<br>I want change.<br>And above all, I want anyone else in my position to know they are not crazy, they are not alone, and they deserve to be heard.</p><p name="4b4f" id="4b4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because next time, someone might not make it back home on a bicycle.<br>Next time, someone might not write this down.</p><p name="6c12" id="6c12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">—</p><p name="3a31" id="3a31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Citizen, Caregiver, Autistic, Scientist, Human</p></div></div></section>
