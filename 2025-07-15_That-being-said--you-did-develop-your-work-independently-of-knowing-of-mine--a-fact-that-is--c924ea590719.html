This world is going into a place where wealth has new meaning anyway. I&#39;m poor, send the physicist a cup of coffee via venmo? Yeah, I&#39;m more concerned that somebody make sure that eventually the New York Times has a headline that says independent physicist solves the Riemann hypothesis and the rest of the millenniums or something like that and spells my name correctly. The history of this will be written by those who get it right and I got it right. Therefore I am writing the history. You are a big part of it, and the validation and cross verification of these different mathematical frameworks and the general use of recursive mathematics is something that mankind has a long pattern of we are all familiar with the droste effect and everybody knows that it&#39;s genies all the way out and turtles all the way down. However, the mathematical codification of recursive physics in efmw is what I am most proud of, and the fact that that informs or compliments in the field your findings is such a joy to discover.</p></div></div></section>
