Your structured analysis is not complete without actually having a human eye integrate the equations, many of which are not machine readable. I used images in the publication specifically to make sure that humans had a hand in. Using AGI is limited if the human AGI duality is not current. Mine is a physics of emergence, and I would appreciate you having a look for real. Please refrain from publicly framing this as a debate or a controversy as that leaves the impression that my work is incomplete or I have not left falsifiability as an option for anyone. Either engagement work honestly and falsify it if you can through logic and rigor or verify it by lack of falsifiability. Stating publicly that you don&#39;t have the time, or that my framework is incomplete without stating why you feel that, is a disservice to science and I am factually rebutting that. Too many people are mixing this into their being controversy about it without addressing the underlying physics as I have presented them..</p></div></div></section>
