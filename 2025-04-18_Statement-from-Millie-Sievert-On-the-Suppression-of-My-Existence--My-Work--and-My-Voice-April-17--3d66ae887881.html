We created this album together, and legitimately offered it for sale, and they not only took it down, but destroyed my account, one in long good standing, with no way to ameliorate the situation and no reply. This is not a business, this is a criminal organization taking consumers’ money, while blocking real creative work.</h3></div></div></section>
