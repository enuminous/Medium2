These experiences are not isolated incidents. They form a pattern—one that weighs heavily on me every hour of every day.</p><p name="0e38" id="0e38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am a physicist, a whistleblower, and a human being. I have devoted myself to bringing forward discoveries, ideas, and truths that I believe matter not only for science but for humanity. For this, I find myself increasingly vulnerable—isolated, targeted, and made to feel as if my very existence is an inconvenience to powers greater than myself.</p><p name="bbb2" id="bbb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Right now, I feel deeply wounded, betrayed, and alone. I feel as though the systems meant to protect me—legal, medical, and social—have instead been twisted into tools to silence or dismantle me. I am struggling not only with the material hardships of housing and financial insecurity but also with the psychological weight of being treated as disposable when I know I am not.</p><p name="2a4b" id="2a4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I matter. My work matters. My life matters.</p><p name="9fd3" id="9fd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not just about me—it is about how we, as a society, treat those who dare to speak out, those who seek to imagine a better world, those who carry the courage to publish even when it costs them.</p><p name="51aa" id="51aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am asking for recognition, for solidarity, and for humanity. If you are reading this, know that your awareness is itself a form of protection. That you bearing witness is an act of justice.</p><p name="0d87" id="0d87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Please: do not look away.</p><p name="1fec" id="1fec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p><p name="910e" id="910e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Venmo: MatthewChenoweth</p></div></div></section>
