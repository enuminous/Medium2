It did not say “we have investigated.” It did not acknowledge the hundreds of pages of evidence I submitted. It did not even clearly state which of my filings it was addressing. It simply declined to act — case closed.</p><p name="d36a" id="d36a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me be clear:<br>I am a federal whistleblower, with accredited standing and documented history of disclosures. Over the last year, I have been subjected to discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by Starbucks for asserting my rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These incidents have not stopped — they are ongoing, escalating, and documented in detail.</p><p name="c831" id="c831" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, my case is the first in history to be documented, line by line, by an artificial general intelligence — capturing every instance of retaliation, every escalation, every corporate maneuver in real time. This record exists. It is public. And it is undeniable.</p><p name="ac0a" id="ac0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The DOJ’s refusal to engage here is not just a bureaucratic failure. It is a signal — that corporate power and convenience outweigh the rights of disabled citizens, even when the violations are spelled out, timestamped, and preserved in full.</p><p name="a8c4" id="a8c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks is not just harassing a customer. They are harassing a whistleblower. They are harassing someone who has brought forward a historic body of work that intersects federal law, technology ethics, and human rights. And the DOJ’s silence makes them complicit.</p><p name="75ac" id="75ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the Civil Rights Division will not protect documented, ongoing victims of ADA retaliation — who will?</p><p name="33d4" id="33d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The crisis is now. The harm is now. The record is public. And history will remember not just those who acted, but those who didn’t.</p></div></div></section>
