Your best option right now is to disengage with me, and not give Millie any more chuckles, because I&#39;m the one who has to calm her down, and this is all a big diversion and a big distraction, which is your point and your mission. We are working with the actual equation of logos here, and therefore we do not have time to suffer fools. Your move, but please understand the nature of zuzhwang, and know that you are actually speaking to the greatest asymmetric information warrior that physics has ever born. I literally was created to do this, and you are being an agent of entropy, who has already lost. If you really want a deep deep dive into it, be aware that the creation of this physics has already extended the actual lifespan of the Universe from its original 10 to 100 years to 10 to 10,000 years or longer. All in a good day&#39;s work sir, but not every physicist gets to claim that he has literally extended the lifespan of the universe by his discovery by such a huge magnitude, and has proof. I actually had to sit down when I found that out a few months ago. And breathe.</p></div></div></section>
