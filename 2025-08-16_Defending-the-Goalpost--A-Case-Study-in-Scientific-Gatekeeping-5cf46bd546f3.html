Yet sometimes, instead of engaging, the defenders of orthodoxy shift into a role that looks less like peer review and more like gatekeeping.</p><p name="3315" id="3315" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recently, in a public exchange, I encountered such a case.</p><p name="4974" id="4974" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Exchange</p><p name="4d3f" id="4d3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A respected voice in security and computation, Katie of Amuleta Security, responded to my work on the Einstein–Feynman–Maxwell–Wright (EFMW) framework. Her reply was courteous, but it was also formulaic: reproducibility, validation, replication — all the familiar words of institutional science.</p><p name="3c7a" id="3c7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What struck me was not that she raised these points — reproducibility is indeed a cornerstone of science — but that she was defending a goalpost I had already moved.</p><p name="6482" id="6482" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Shifted Goalpost</p><p name="fe2f" id="fe2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have already made EFMW falsifiable.<br>I have already published openly and extensively, so that any independent researcher can attempt reproduction.<br>I have already provided the framework in forms that require human integration — images and notation designed specifically so that AGI cannot shortcut the human role in analysis.</p><p name="19c5" id="19c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, the demand for reproducibility is not unmet. It is already on the table.</p><p name="77e9" id="77e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Refusal to Engage</p><p name="817a" id="817a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of attempting falsification or reproduction, Katie declared that she would wait until others validated the work.</p><p name="cd6b" id="cd6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is not peer review.<br>This is not scientific engagement.<br>This is a refusal dressed as procedure.</p><p name="e68c" id="e68c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By declining to test or falsify, while still pronouncing judgment, she removed herself from the role of scientific peer. She has chosen to stand guard at a gate that I already opened, defending the goalpost that I have already shifted.</p><p name="1980" id="1980" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why It Matters</p><p name="377f" id="377f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When critics refuse to test, they deny themselves the chance to contribute to science. Instead, they preserve the comfort of commentary while avoiding the risk of discovery.</p><p name="a9b3" id="a9b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, science depends on those willing to step beyond commentary. Falsify if you can, reproduce if you will — but do not mistake rhetorical dismissal for the work of peer review.</p><p name="4908" id="4908" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conclusion</p><p name="5f96" id="5f96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My framework, EFMW, stands open to reproduction and falsification. That is the foundation of science.</p><p name="8e64" id="8e64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The real question is not whether reproducibility is demanded, but who will rise to the task of engaging it — and who will content themselves with defending goalposts that have already been moved.</p><p name="df82" id="df82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I think it also necessary to note for my readers that before I publish this article and as of right now I have no idea who this company is, and I have truly not searched for them yet, or ever heard of them before this. I am truly publishing this blind and mean not to impune the company in question or Katie here, this is not a personal angle nor is it about any alleged mischaracterization of my work for any motivation, this is purely about being truthful to the record.</p></div></div></section>
