Richard Wright taught Public School in Vallejo for 55 years Junior high and then high school and then some Junior college as an adjunct professor there. English, history, you name it. He took his students to deer Creek, where the Yahi Indians died out except the man who called himself Ishi but never revealed his real name. Coincidentally, my roommate is related to Kurt rademacher. Yes, my dad taught me mirror and thorough and the value of stillness in a universe that can never be still. My father is now in senior care, with 24/7 attention, but he is still sound of mind and has understood what his son has done. He is so proud of me. I am so proud of him. We have managed to heal the difficult relationship that we had.</p></div></div></section>
