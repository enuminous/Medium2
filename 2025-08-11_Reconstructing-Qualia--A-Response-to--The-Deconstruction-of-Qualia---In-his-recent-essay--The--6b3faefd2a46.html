From this, he concludes that the so-called “hard problem” of consciousness is a category error.<br><br>The piece is lucidly written, but its conclusions rest on assumptions that deserve closer scrutiny.<br><br>1. The Illusionist Frame Is Not the Only Coherent Frame<br><br>The author’s taxonomy — “processed feeling” vs. “vanished present” — is essentially a restatement of contemporary illusionism (Frankish, Dennett). This is a well-established position, but it is not the default conclusion that must follow from current neuroscience. Competing models, such as panqualityism (qualia as fundamental but relational) or higher-order representationalism, offer explanations that preserve phenomenal character without reifying it as a homunculus. Ignoring these alternatives makes the dismissal of qualia premature.<br><br>2. The “Vanished Present” Is Contested Territory<br><br>The idea that the present is in principle inaccessible leans heavily on a pointillist view of perception — as if our experience is a sequence of already-gone snapshots. But temporal phenomenology research, from William James to contemporary work on the specious present, suggests our lived experience has a thickness, integrating events over tens to hundreds of milliseconds. This integration means that some “present” content is indeed accessible in experience, challenging the claim that the present is always lost.<br><br>3. The Dilemma Framing Oversimplifies<br><br>By presenting the reader with only two options — factual error or unprovable belief — the argument sidelines middle-ground views. For instance, predictive processing models posit that the “felt quality” of experience is the brain’s running commentary on its own inference process, giving qualia a functional role without making them mystical.<br><br>4. The Hard Problem Is Reframed, Not Solved<br><br>Declaring the hard problem a category error may resolve it linguistically, but this doesn’t explain why conscious states feel like something from the inside. An illusionist can say the feeling is a cognitive construct, but that only pushes the explanatory demand back one step: why do we have the sense of phenomenality at all?<br><br>5. Engagement With the Literature Would Strengthen the Case<br><br>While the metaphors in The Deconstruction of Qualia are effective, the argument would benefit from engaging with the body of work it is implicitly addressing — Nagel’s “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?”, Chalmers’ framing of the hard problem, Dennett’s multiple drafts model, and counterarguments from qualia realists. Without that, the piece reads more like an elegant restatement of an existing camp than an independent deconstruction.<br><br><br>---<br><br>Conclusion:<br>The Deconstruction of Qualia is a clear, readable expression of illusionism. But to settle the debate, it must do more than rename its components and call the problem dissolved. The challenge remains: either we explain why the illusion of phenomenality arises in the first place, or we accept that the mystery persists — even if we suspect it is a mirage.</p></div></div></section>
