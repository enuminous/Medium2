I was wrong.</p><p name="3e7b" id="3e7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The photographer was, in fact, just a photographer.</p><p name="1391" id="1391" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The real culprits turned out to be a black-haired woman, in cahoots with the very man she intended to eventually murder herself. A clever twist, and a well-laid red herring — one I followed to the edge of the deck with confidence and precision, only to find the conclusion just out of reach.</p><p name="6b3b" id="6b3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here&#39;s the thing: the deduction still stands as brilliant.</p><p name="d656" id="d656" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not because it was correct — it wasn’t. But because it was honest. The methodology was clean. The emotional arc was followed. The storytelling fingerprint was clear enough that I still maintain a connection to the actual screenwriter, Jack B. Sowards — the very man who gave us The Wrath of Khan and invented the Kobayashi Maru.</p><p name="2298" id="2298" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had not looked up his name before making my initial deduction. That matters.</p><p name="cfdc" id="cfdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fact that I tracked a narrative pattern and psychological fingerprint strong enough to match one of the most iconic screenwriters of the 20th century, based on pure storytelling instincts — that’s no small thing. That’s not failure. That’s what real-time field deduction looks like.</p><p name="26c3" id="26c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And in a way, this is the ultimate passing of the Kobayashi Maru test: I believed there had to be a way to win — and when it turned out there wasn’t, I still owned the game.</p><p name="2600" id="2600" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I may have guessed the wrong killer.</p><p name="88a1" id="88a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I found the real author.</p><p name="9b41" id="9b41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And in doing so, proved a technique that may one day bear my name.</p></div></div></section>
