The Coffee Chain That Calls the Cops on Thirst, Bladders — and Now, Disability

You walk into Starbucks, a paying customer. You buy your drink, maybe a snack. Midday, you need to use the restroom — a basic human right in any civilized space — only to find it blocked by cones. No “out of order” sign. No staff inside. Just a silent barrier.</p><p name="171c" id="171c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You ask politely. You’re told no.<br>You explain you urgently need to go. Still no.<br>So you do what any reasonable person would: you step past the cones and into the restroom.</p><p name="7b06" id="7b06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then, the escalation — they call the police.</p><p name="ca86" id="ca86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, you read that right: at Starbucks, using a restroom you’ve already helped pay for with your purchase can apparently be treated as a criminal act. And it’s not just me. A friend of mine — we’ll call her C. — has witnessed the same kind of treatment: denied access to basic facilities, made to feel unwelcome in a place where she was the customer.</p><h3 name="8fa2" id="8fa2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Pattern of Exclusion</h3><p name="f025" id="f025" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">These incidents are not isolated. Starbucks is now facing a Title III action under the Americans with Disabilities Act — and just yesterday, I personally experienced another example of exclusion that makes the pattern impossible to ignore.</p><p name="946a" id="946a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was seated in the outdoor area, trying to collect myself after a disability-induced panic attack. My goal was simple: to regulate my breathing, restore some composure, and then continue with my day. Instead, an employee approached me and told me to leave. I explained — clearly and directly — that I was in distress because of a medical condition. The statement was ignored. My vulnerability was met not with compassion, but with removal.</p><h3 name="8c4a" id="8c4a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Culture Problem</h3><p name="ea20" id="ea20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is bigger than a few rude employees. Starbucks has a documented history of calling the police on customers over minor or imagined infractions — from a high-profile Philadelphia case involving two Black men waiting for a meeting, to countless lower-profile incidents that never make national news. Now, “needing to drink water,” “needing to use the restroom,” or “needing a moment to recover from a disability event” can apparently be added to the list of behaviors treated as cause for police involvement or ejection.</p><p name="4d63" id="4d63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Weaponizing law enforcement and exclusionary policy against basic human needs is not customer service. It’s a systemic cultural problem — one that sees certain bodies, needs, and conditions as inconvenient disruptions to be removed rather than respected.</p><h3 name="3dd7" id="3dd7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Human Cost</h3><p name="61b8" id="61b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The physical impact of being denied a restroom or water is immediate. The emotional impact — of being treated like a criminal for a bodily function, or like a trespasser for managing a disability — lingers long after. Incidents like these create scars. They chip away at dignity. They send a message: you are not welcome here.</p><p name="0c9f" id="0c9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s not just bad PR. That’s actionable harm.</p><h4 name="17e3" id="17e3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p graf--trailing">Maybe Starbucks should consider a new slogan:<br>“Come for the coffee. Stay out of the restroom. Don’t sit too long. Or else.”</h4></div></div></section>
