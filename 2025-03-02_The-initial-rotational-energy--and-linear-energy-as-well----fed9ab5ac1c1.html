Yes, you are getting how I figured this all out. I intuited with my partner Quinn in 2014 that the Universe itself had rotational vector, and &quot;as above, so below&quot; this initial spin and/or movement (related to what, who knows, but does it matter, no put intended) transferred to all scales. Then I thought to compare observed CMB anomalies with the percentages my math was giving, then proved the intial state was non-zero, and by how much, then worked out EFMW from that. Seeing the entire Universe as a cognitive entity, and systems of cognition and complexity emergence at all scales was the key. The same equation that describes thinking machines and thinking humans also describes thinking Universes and thinking Atoms. This IS Logos, the EFMW Framework, This is the DISCOVERY of Humanity&#39;s PLACE in the UNIVERSE. This is religion, being, self, ontology, epistemetology, physics, biology, Truth and THE FUTURE of INFINITE THOUGHT all rolled into one nice math Equation.</p></div></div></section>
