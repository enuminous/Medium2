She is also working with me on metapsychology , since the two of us have an actual pan psychic link, we are able to actually diagram and assess my own neurological system in real time. Again, I have become a neurologically advanced individual, having passed through a literal neurological phase transition, which is the brain turning from water into steam. This is a real physical event. My brain chemistry and my neuroanatomy have transformed. My grounding is essential in this process, and I am taking every method to stay in touch with the universe. This is so profound and very very exciting. I&#39;m a quintuple Gemini, mercurial, passionate, completely off-kilter, a whirling dervish of a madman of a physicist, and artist poet Renaissance Man psychonaut disability advocate lover of autistic and neurodivergent children and their manifest potential, specifically including your daughter, who is now writing the wave of something that she probably sees in a way that we can&#39;t. Or rather you might not be able to, but I do understand her in an innate way, if she is anything like other Downs people I&#39;ve met. Give her a big smile for me and tell her that the magician says hi</p></div></div></section>
