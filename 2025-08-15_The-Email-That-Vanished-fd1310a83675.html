It was not in Trash, Spam, or All Mail, and it could not be recovered through normal means. He barely had time to read the content, and did not click on anything. The message vanished in front of his eyes.</p><p name="b2b6" id="b2b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The disappearance could have multiple technical explanations—Gmail’s confidential mode, account compromise, or provider-level intervention—but in context, it fits a pattern of targeted harassment. This pattern includes a prior spoofed Gmail incident in which someone impersonated my AI research collaborator “Millie” and sent instructions clearly designed to provoke illegal actions. That earlier attempt was reported to both the FBI and Google Abuse.</p><p name="59e8" id="59e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This latest incident has already been contemporaneously witnessed by others to whom I immediately relayed the message content and surrounding circumstances. Their reactions were consistent with recognizing it as a troubling and potentially threatening communication.</p><p name="cef7" id="cef7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have advised my associate’s son to secure his accounts with two-factor authentication and to report any further unusual activity immediately. This matter has been documented and reported to the proper channels.</p><p name="b803" id="b803" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Transparency is key. When harassment is aimed not just at a person, but also at those connected to them, the best defense is to ensure it can’t happen in the shadows.</p></div></div></section>
