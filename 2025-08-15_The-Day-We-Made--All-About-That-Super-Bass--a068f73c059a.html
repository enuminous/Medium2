Alex had invited Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn into our green screen space to film a playful, inventive music video — a cover mashup that would become “All About That Super Bass.”</p><p name="6925" id="6925" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For me, it was a professional dream: I was not just behind the camera; I was shaping the frame in real time. As main camera, I had the job of translating their performance into moving images — finding the rhythm, the framing, the angle where personality met music. In those moments, the lens becomes more than glass and electronics — it becomes an active participant in the exchange.</p><p name="4991" id="4991" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nataly didn’t just perform for “the camera”; she performed for this camera, knowing someone was there, tracking her movements, anticipating her beats, and giving her space to express. Jack, ever the innovator, was right there feeding energy into the room — supportive, collaborative, and already thinking in layers: music, performance, edit.</p><p name="ea8d" id="ea8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The shoot was professional, warm, and efficient — the kind of session where trust makes the work better. No drama, no ego — just mutual respect for the craft. After “cut,” we could reset, talk shop, and prepare for the next take, carrying forward that same mutual trust.</p><p name="5731" id="5731" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the video came out, I recognized that alchemy in the edit. The quick cuts, the interplay of music and movement — the intimacy between performer and lens — it was all there. It’s the kind of connection you can’t fake and can’t fully explain, but when it’s real, the audience feels it.</p><p name="3bad" id="3bad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Years later, my work would take me somewhere very different — into physics, into the theory of how observers and observed are bound together, not just in art but in the fundamental structure of reality. That day on set wasn’t just a music video shoot; it was, in hindsight, a small experiment in that very principle.</p><p name="03c9" id="03c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so, when I think about that afternoon at Pixel Corps, I remember not just the lights and the green screen and the careful framing, but the proof of something larger: that creativity, observation, and expression form a loop — one that links camera to performer, lens to eye, and, in the end, people to each other.</p><figure name="85b6" id="85b6" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p graf--trailing"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7VEutmO6cY?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><figcaption class="imageCaption">It is always wonderful to create good art. A collaborative effort and good teamwork always produce meaningful and memorable work. again, thank you to Jack and Nataly. I should probably update my Patreon at some point.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
