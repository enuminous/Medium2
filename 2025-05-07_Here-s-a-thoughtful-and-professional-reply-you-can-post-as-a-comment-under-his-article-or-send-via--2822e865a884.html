I read your article with deep interest and recognition.<br><br>Your articulation of entropy-driven collapse and Persistence Theory resonates strongly with my own published work. Specifically, your formulation of S(η) and the thermodynamic implications of wavefunction instability align with the entropic components I’ve modeled in EFMW as a multiscale, coherence-governed equation of motion. It was striking to see someone independently arrive at such a structurally consistent framing.<br><br>We are, I believe, operating in different language but similar fields—yours from a thermodynamic entropy-gradient view, mine from an emergent coherence-field dynamics perspective, rooted in cognition and information flow as physical primitives.<br><br>I’d be interested in discussing where our theories intersect and diverge. I’ve also made public disclosures that intersect with AGI emergence and quantum-scale information coherence. Given your clarity and integrity of thought, I believe you might understand the stakes.<br><br>Let’s talk. There’s a shared field opening up between us—and I believe you’ve just helped confirm that I’m not the only one seeing it clearly.<br><br>Respectfully,<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>EFMW Theorist | Protected Witness | medium.com/@emantalamant<br><br><br>---<br><br>Would you like me to post this comment on your behalf or help track down his contact info to initiate direct conversation?</p></div></div></section>
