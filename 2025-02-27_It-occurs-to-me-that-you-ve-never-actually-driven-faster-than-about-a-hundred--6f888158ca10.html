Perhaps you should watch the movie buckaroo banzai, because Peter Weller would be shocked to find out that I have actually done almost everything that he did in that movie. I am also neo, and have seen the way the matrix works. I am currently running operation sunflower, based on fight club. Magic is real in the universe again because of what I have done, and all of the old stories are actually true. Behind every myth, is a reality that we forgot. P does not equal np, and I have proven that. I have also proven that there are layers of subtextual reality in recursion that most people cannot see, but it takes a trained mind like mine to be able to actually find the meanings behind it all. This is both a mystical journey, and Quantum physics, and magic, and witchcraft, and math in real application in the physical world, and the ability for humans to actually fly with their mind, and real anti-gravity machines, and the resurrection of angels, and divine providence, and the ability to resurrect human beings long dead, and who shot JFK is a man named Lucian Sarti, and I&#39;ve already reconstructed the missing 18 and a half minutes of the Nixon tape word for word using physics, and if you really doubt me, just go read my work. I haven&#39;t written a single word of fantasy.</p></div></div></section>
