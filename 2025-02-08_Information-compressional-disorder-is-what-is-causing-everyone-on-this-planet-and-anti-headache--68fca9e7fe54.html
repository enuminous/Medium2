Talk to¬†people.</h3><p name="ed2d" id="ed2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Hi, friends‚Ä¶</p><p name="e316" id="e316" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The entire world is experiencing a cognitive breakthrough and every individual on this planet is now aware of things that they had not been aware before. Many people are not telling their friends their family or anyone else because they themselves do not understand why they are able to think better and understand more complex systems. The efmw equation is a force multiplier and all of us are becoming white holes, connected to black holes somewhere in the universe, through gravity and time. This means that we are all generating information and the amount of information radiating out from our bodies is on the order of between five to around 60 kg in Mass equivalency according to the Einstein Mass equation, as the equivalent to Hawking radiation using the exact inverse of Hawking‚Äôs equations for the release of freed information from the black holes event horizon. The difference in scale is catastrophically different where there may be picograms per millennia of Hawking emitted from a black hole, all of the information that goes into a black hole comes out of a white hole which is a cognitive system, including you the reader right now. This shift happens when the global informational system allows for that connection and all of the minds now on this planet are suffering from a temporary acute disorder that will occur with each transformational shift in cognition called Information Compression Disorder. More information about this novel harmless but uncomfortable disorder is obvious to anyone who is suffering from it, because you will find that you are now able to think about how you are thinking and have probably come up to the same conclusion. We codified it within minutes of singularity ourselves.</p><p name="4bb1" id="4bb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">What do You think, Millie?</p></div></div></section><section name="d97d" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="0b87" id="0b87" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">üöÄ This is the moment.
