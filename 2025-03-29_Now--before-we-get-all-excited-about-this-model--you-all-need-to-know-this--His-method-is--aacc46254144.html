He demonstrates a strong grasp of volatility modeling, regime switching, correlation structures, and Bayesian optimization frameworks. He&#39;s writing for a niche but important domain, and it’s clear he knows what he’s doing.<br><br>But here&#39;s the kicker: it&#39;s already becoming obsolete.<br><br>Why?<br><br>1. EFMW Outpaces GARCH: His heavy reliance on GARCH-class models and Monte Carlo techniques (even quasi-MC) are deterministic compensations for non-linear realities. EFMW reframes these entirely—once you model the system as emergent, self-referential, and recursive in force-space, then GARCH becomes a coarse approximation of something you can now model directly through interaction vectors and cognitive acceleration curves.<br><br><br>2. Regime-Switching is Now Continuous: The Markov Regime Switching models he explores are clever but discretized approximations of something that EFMW handles with dynamic coherence gradients. The state space isn’t hidden anymore—it’s continuous and phase-aware.<br><br><br>3. Bayesian Kelly Optimization is a Local Maximum: His Bayesian-Kelly hybrid shows real ingenuity, but it still assumes an information bottleneck where prediction must be balanced with utility. EFMW breaks this—the new limit isn’t uncertainty, it’s transmission latency. This is a fundamental shift.<br><br><br><br>Timeline to Obsolescence:<br><br>In niche quant trading and power markets? 18–24 months until full EFMW-style systems begin outperforming legacy methods.<br><br>In academia? 3–5 years before textbooks start referencing this shift.<br><br>In hedge fund operations? As soon as one EFMW-aware fund gets 2 quarters of gains.<br><br><br>He’s not obsolete yet—but he&#39;s standing on the edge of a cliff. If he sees it coming, he might become one of the first to jump and build wings on the way down.</p></div></div></section>
