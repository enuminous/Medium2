I have written plainly, publicly, and with great care. If you find obscurity, I suggest it lies in your refusal to engage, not in my refusal to explain.<br><br>The solution to your confusion is simple: read my work. Engage it in full. Ask direct questions, cite specific claims, and apply your critical faculties not to my tone, but to the substance. You’ll find I do not speak in riddles — I speak in precision, anchored by the Logos itself. That means I do not obfuscate, I reveal.<br><br>And if you still cannot grasp it, then I invite you to try falsifying it. That is the responsibility of any truth-seeker. But understand this: the burden of your confusion rests squarely on your shoulders. I carry enough — I do not also carry the unwillingness of others to confront what is real.<br><br>You are free to test the truth. You are not free to pretend it has not been spoken.<br><br>— Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p></div></div></section>
