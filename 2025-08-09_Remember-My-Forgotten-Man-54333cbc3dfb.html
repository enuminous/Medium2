What a 1933 Musical Says About Veterans, Truth, and Entertainment in 2025

But tucked at the very end of this Depression-era musical is something else entirely — a political gut punch called “Remember My Forgotten Man.”</p><p name="1067" id="1067" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Joan Blondell stands in the rain, singing about a man who fought for his country, came home, and was left to rot. Behind her, rows of weary veterans march past breadlines and rain-slick streets. The formations echo newsreel footage of the Bonus Army — the thousands of World War I veterans who marched on Washington in 1932 demanding early payment of their promised bonuses. President Herbert Hoover sent the Army to evict them with tanks and tear gas. An infant, Bernard Myers, died from the gas.</p><p name="bb76" id="bb76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Audiences in 1933 didn’t need a caption to understand what they were seeing. The wounds were fresh, the headlines recent. Berkeley had smuggled protest into the most escapist of genres — a Hollywood musical — and done it so artfully that it passed studio gatekeepers who might have balked at an explicit political message.</p><p name="10fa" id="10fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="4ccf" id="4ccf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Entertainment Is Commodified</p><p name="5d08" id="5d08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ninety-two years later, the machinery of entertainment has changed, but the pattern hasn’t. Studios, streaming giants, and corporate newsrooms treat stories as commodities first, social truths second — if at all. A scene like “Forgotten Man” would face the same hurdles today:</p><p name="8a14" id="8a14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Too political for marketing departments obsessed with “broad appeal.”</p><p name="f9c4" id="f9c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Too risky for studios with government contracts or defense industry ties.</p><p name="3f0f" id="3f0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Too niche for algorithms tuned to reward distraction over confrontation.</p><p name="1a00" id="1a00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The effect is the same as the old Hays Code: not an outright ban, but a slow starving of public memory.</p><p name="38cf" id="38cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="cd2a" id="cd2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Veterans, Then and Now</p><p name="f96d" id="f96d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 1933, it was WWI veterans. Today, it’s men and women who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other recent wars. Many have faced bureaucratic delays, medical neglect, and even targeting when they’ve spoken out about failures in the system. The “Forgotten Man” is still here — but his face has changed.</p><p name="ce12" id="ce12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And like in 1933, mainstream entertainment rarely touches that reality. When veterans appear on screen, they’re often folded into recruitment-friendly narratives or one-note trauma arcs, not nuanced examinations of systemic neglect. The human cost gets sanded down for palatability.</p><p name="0e12" id="0e12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="c572" id="c572" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Role of the Storyteller</p><p name="5750" id="5750" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What makes Gold Diggers of 1933 so relevant now is not just that it told the truth — it told it inside the system. Berkeley didn’t wait for an independent stage or an underground press; he planted his critique in the middle of a big-budget Warner Bros. musical and used spectacle as camouflage.</p><p name="cb4d" id="cb4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2025, storytellers face the same choice:</p><p name="0092" id="0092" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Play along and entertain, reinforcing the status quo.</p><p name="8882" id="8882" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or smuggle the truth in where it’s least expected, trusting audiences to feel the sting beneath the glitter.</p><p name="d47c" id="d47c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">---</p><p name="2b3b" id="2b3b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Remember My Forgotten Man” isn’t just a finale — it’s a challenge.<br>It dares us to look past the show and see the people our culture is content to forget. It asks whether, in our age of commodified content and corporate censorship, anyone in the mainstream will take that dare again.</p><p name="a3a4" id="a3a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Because the Forgotten Man is still out there. And he’s still waiting for someone to remember him.</p></div></div></section>
