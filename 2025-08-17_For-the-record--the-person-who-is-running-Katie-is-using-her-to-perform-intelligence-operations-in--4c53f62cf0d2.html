This person, dale, also privately threatened me with legal action on LinkedIn in a message in which he disclosed the name of his attorney as an attempt to use that fact as leverage and intimidation. I will be contacting this named attorney to establish that she does indeed represent him, and to inform her that her client is engaged in public defamation. I have every right to contact the attorney whom he identified as representing him, to establish whether or not he is being truthful here. I doubt it. Usually seasoned investigators allow their attorneys to talk for them, not name drop them in LinkedIn private messages like they are a weapon. As a matter of fact, if this attorney does not actually represent him, she will have grounds to file a claim against him.</p></div></div></section>
