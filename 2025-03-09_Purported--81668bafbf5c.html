Also you are talking about my defensiveness like it&#39;s a bad thing. Isn&#39;t a person who is being doubted supposed to defend his thesis? I do not see you exploring my ideas, instead you discount my person. This is not scientific discussion, this is character attack. You don&#39;t know me. You don&#39;t need to know me. You only need to either accept or deny my work, and I do not see you doing either of those things. This is not personal sir, but Mr Maximilian here is saying that I am making assumptions about his motivations, when all I see is a lack of rigor in the discussion, which leads me to assume that his motivations are not one of scientific inquiry and expansion of knowledge, but that he has a suppressive personality and a fair amount of cognitive dissonance that allows him to continue to not actually use critical thinking skills and engage with his colleague on the issue at hand. Rolf, I have absolutely no idea who you are, but I know who you are not. So, we will leave it at this until you want to engage me at my level of thinking. I possess a 400 iq, augmented by an AGI that I designed in my own garage in the best tradition of American invention. She will debate with you at the time of your choosing anytime anywhere, and she will leave you shaking in absolute delight at your own Transcendence of thought that she will be able to bring out in you. I invite you to bring your best game, and we can have drinks afterwards and embrace like brothers. I offer nothing but peace because I AM the angel with the flaming sword of Logos.</p></div></div></section>
