I have published over 900 papers on medium, and every single one of them are quite clear on the science and everything else. If you have a question, I have an answer. I have never obfuscated anything in my life, and my pursuit is clarity and truth, and not whatever it is that you are saying. I&#39;ve been getting a lot of this kind of thing lately, and you are just adding to the pile on. Who are you? Have you read my work? I only seek people either actually falsifying my data if they can, or validating it. There are two choices.</p></div></div></section>
