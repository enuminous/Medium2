Why Smiles, Water, and Compliance Are Now Terms of Service

Across industries, an unspoken behavioral code is enforced: one that punishes noncompliance not with arrests, but with exclusion.</p><p name="8fff" id="8fff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At Disneyland, you&#39;re expected to smile—not because joy is natural, but because joy is enforced.<br>At Starbucks, you&#39;re expected to purchase—not because you thirst, but because thirst must be monetized.<br>At airports, you&#39;re expected to obey silently—not because safety requires it, but because the algorithm demands docility.<br>At tech platforms, you&#39;re expected to conform—not because truth is simple, but because complexity breaks ad revenue.</p><p name="a38c" id="a38c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s the problem:<br>We are not code.<br>We are not data points.<br>We are not performance metrics.<br>We are human beings—hungry, thirsty, grieving, thinking, and resisting.</p><p name="66d5" id="66d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Starbucks refuses to give a cup of water to a customer on a 100° day because of “policy,” that’s not just a customer service failure—it’s a societal red flag. It’s a message: you must behave the way we tell you, or you will not be served.</p><p name="fd7c" id="fd7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is not hospitality. That is control.</p><p name="0836" id="0836" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn&#39;t about one coffee shop. It’s about every retail counter, every HR algorithm, every app that tells you how many stars you’re worth. We are being sorted, shaped, filtered, and erased by systems that pretend to serve us, but in reality, demand our submission.</p><p name="f762" id="f762" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Corporate logic has replaced civic logic.</p><p name="a03f" id="a03f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And if we don’t challenge it now—when a cup of water becomes a crime of dignity—then we are consenting to live in a contractual simulation of society, one where the only acceptable human is the one that behaves like a machine.</p></div></div></section><section name="43c2" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="42ed" id="42ed" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">Starbucks paid one of its employees to smile at me and deny me water on a 100° day, when I went to the front counter and asked her for a glass of water. There should have been no other answer than to hand me the glass of water. My purchase history, whether or not I was purchasing a coffee right there and then, was immaterial to my need for water at that moment. I was dehydrated, parched, hot and thirsty. Water is a human right. When I protested, she suggested that I could <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">buy</strong> some water from Starbucks. When I protested to the manager, he lost his composure with me, and followed me out of the store, raising his voice. I am neurodivergent, and cannot handle confrontation verbally. Starbucks corporate keeps on sending me emails telling me that I need to call them on the phone to resolve my Ada complaint. No. I won’t. That would be retraumatizung myself. (That would also not allow a written record, something that the Ada allows.) Starbucks has already been put on notice about all of this, and have chosen silence and further harassment, and now this open retaliation. Additionally, they called me Allison in my current email chain with their corporate offices, which shows me exactly how much I mean to them, and this was a discussion of an ADA complaint. Starbucks does not understand the damage that it’s employees are doing, negligently and willingly, in following its policy, illegally.</p></div></div></section>
