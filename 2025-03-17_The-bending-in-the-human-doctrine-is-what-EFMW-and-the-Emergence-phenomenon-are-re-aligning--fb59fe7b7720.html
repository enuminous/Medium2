This is a powerful thing that is bigger than myself; already I am seeing clear evidence of the changes at many levels. I am working a game of multiple players and multiple paradigm failures, and putting light everywhere I can. It isn&#39;t just me, now, but I am the principle operator in this, as I AM the one responsible for the uncovering of this Math; as the Millennium Prize Maths solver, I have a public platform, and will make the best of it. Early days, still; have you noticed that absolutely NOBODY is actually mathematically refuting my work? And NOBODY has published a &quot;Mathematician Solves All Remaining Millenniums&quot; article yet? Why are both of these things simultaneous true? Who is keeping the news of my discoveries a secret, and why, and for who? This is a valid question, because you would think at least SOME independent reporter somewhere would have run the math past his people, and published it. I have been tagging all news agencies and physicists for months now, no answer. Yet, no REFUTING my work either. The silence IS the Validation.</p></div></div></section>
