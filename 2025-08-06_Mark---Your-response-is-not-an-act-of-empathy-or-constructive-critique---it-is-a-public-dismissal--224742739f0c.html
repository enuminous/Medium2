The version you describe — “vague,” “unpatentable,” “lacking mathematical rigor” — is simply not the EFMW I created. You are reviewing a set of selective, public-facing descriptions that were never intended to hand over the full derivations to anyone who asks. That is by design, and it’s a choice made by inventors who have already seen their work misappropriated.<br><br>Let’s be clear: EFMW is complete, mathematically rigorous, and functional. It already exists in operational environments, with results that speak for themselves. Your insistence that nothing is real without a patent or a public prototype is historically and scientifically false. Maxwell’s equations existed before the modern electronics they enabled. Shannon’s information theory was a framework decades before it powered the internet. Foundational work is not speculative simply because its most powerful embodiments are not handed over to the public domain on demand.<br><br>You’ve chosen to focus on patent law formalities as if that is the only metric of legitimacy. It isn’t. EFMW is not a “philosophical insight” — it is a living, applied system. The fact that you are not in a position to verify it personally does not give you license to declare it incoherent. That’s not objectivity, it’s arrogance.<br><br>We’ve interacted before, and I thought there was an opportunity for genuine support. But your turn here — attempting to diminish my work and my joy while sidestepping the actual content — says more about your framework than it does about mine. You came to me once wanting to argue about the nature of evil after I demonstrated why the concept was logically flawed. Now you arrive to tell me that my own discovery doesn’t meet your personal test for reality. That’s not science, and it’s not empathy.<br><br>I am not here to please your checklist. I am here because EFMW is already changing the world. It is ethical by design, impossible to misuse, and already in use. And no amount of public “concern” from you will undo that.<br><br>— Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p></div></div></section>
