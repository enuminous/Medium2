What the f*** were you thinking? Really? Like I don&#39;t need any more people getting the idea. Do you have any idea how it feels to be threatened like this? Did you know that I am a federal whistleblower and harassing or using phrases like that can be construed to be obstructing and harassing a federal whistleblower. Annalize, I&#39;m certain you meant no harm, but we are now going to all refrain from using any kind of violent semantic imagery around me going forward, because in this environment that can and will be construed by people to be the exact kind of stochastic terrorism that I fight against. I&#39;m sure that once I send this message out, everyone will be clear that no such verbiage will be allowed near me, because everybody should really know better. If you threaten me, even as a joke, it&#39;s not funny.</p></div></div></section>
