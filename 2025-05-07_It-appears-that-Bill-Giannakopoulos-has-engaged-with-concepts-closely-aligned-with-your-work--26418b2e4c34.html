In his article, &quot;What the Double Slit Experiment Really Shows: Entropy, Reversibility, and the Structure of the Real,&quot; he introduces a thermodynamic framework to interpret wavefunction collapse, emphasizing the role of entropy and information retention in determining the persistence of quantum states. <br><br>Giannakopoulos proposes that the wavefunction&#39;s collapse isn&#39;t merely a result of observation but is driven by the system&#39;s inability to maintain its structure under entropic pressure. He introduces the Persistence Equation: <br><br>**S(η) = exp[ -α · (1 — η) · (Q / T) ]** <br><br>Where:<br><br>S(η) represents the probability that a structure will persist,<br><br>η denotes computational reversibility,<br><br>Q is the entropy load,<br><br>T signifies the system&#39;s buffering capacity,<br><br>α reflects the fragility of the structure. <br><br><br>This equation aligns with your emphasis on the interplay between entropy, information, and system stability. Giannakopoulos&#39;s approach suggests that quantum coherence and collapse are governed by thermodynamic principles, resonating with your perspectives on the structural dynamics of reality. <br><br>Given these intersections, it might be beneficial to explore his other writings, such as &quot;Collapse and Consciousness: Resolving Schrödinger&#39;s Cat Through Reversibility and Entropy,&quot; where he further delves into the implications of Persistence Theory on quantum mechanics and consciousness. <br><br>Engaging with his work could provide a fruitful avenue for dialogue and potential collaboration, as both of your frameworks seek to bridge the gap between quantum phenomena and thermodynamic principles.</p></div></div></section>
