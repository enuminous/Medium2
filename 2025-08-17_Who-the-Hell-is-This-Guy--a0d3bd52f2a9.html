The Strange Case of Dale Jackaman and Amuleta Security

<section name="3a9b" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="46f1" id="46f1" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">Who the Hell is This Guy?</h3><h3 name="36fe" id="36fe" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">The Strange Case of Dale Jackaman and Amuleta Security</h3><p name="df3b" id="df3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In the world of security, reputation is everything. Private investigators and security professionals live and die by their credibility. Precision, discretion, and professionalism are the tools of the trade. Which is why the recent behavior of Dale Jackaman, president of Amuleta Security, is so baffling.</p><p name="ab72" id="ab72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Public Defamation</p><p name="37a8" id="37a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On Medium, Dale dismissed my physics work not by engaging with it, not by arguing the merits, but by calling me “insane.” That is not peer review. That is not scientific engagement. That is defamation, plain and simple.</p><p name="45ce" id="45ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I demanded a retraction. He refused.</p><p name="738e" id="738e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This alone was unprofessional — a seasoned investigator should know that words matter, especially when published publicly in writing. But what happened next was even stranger.</p><p name="34ff" id="34ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Private Contradiction</p><p name="fa9f" id="fa9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shortly afterward, Dale contacted me privately on LinkedIn. His tone had changed completely. Instead of insults, he turned to a pseudo-legal warning. He:</p><p name="ff71" id="ff71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Claimed his company was “real, accredited, and licensed.”</p><p name="c927" id="c927" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Invoked the name of a California attorney as if she represented him.</p><p name="f94a" id="f94a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Threatened legal action if I continued to describe his behavior as defamatory.</p><p name="0b61" id="0b61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet here’s the contradiction: if Dale truly had retained counsel for this matter, his lawyer would have contacted me directly. Instead, Dale himself issued a “legal warning” over LinkedIn — an unorthodox, sloppy move that raises serious questions.</p><p name="2430" id="2430" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Investigator Who Forgot His Training</p><p name="921f" id="921f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A private investigator of any worth — especially one running a firm with industry reputation — should understand the basics:</p><p name="e1ef" id="e1ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t make reckless public statements.</p><p name="fd5c" id="fd5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t contradict yourself privately.</p><p name="962e" id="962e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t invoke an attorney’s name unless they are actually engaged in the matter.</p><p name="4e0e" id="4e0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t leave a trail that undermines your own credibility.</p><p name="e663" id="e663" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet Dale did all of these things. Public defamation. Private contradictions. Legal name-dropping that may or may not be real. It’s amateur-hour behavior from someone who wants to be seen as a professional operator.</p><p name="1683" id="1683" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What This Says About Reputation</p><p name="a077" id="a077" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is simple: Dale did this to himself.</p><p name="196b" id="196b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He defamed me publicly.</p><p name="812d" id="812d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He contradicted himself privately.</p><p name="9f7d" id="9f7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He refused to retract or apologize.</p><p name="4774" id="4774" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, his credibility suffers — not because of anything I invented, but because of what he chose to put into the record.</p><p name="3e32" id="3e32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So Who the Hell is This Guy?</p><p name="3c1a" id="3c1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The record speaks for itself. A self-described professional who abandoned professional standards. A “solid player” in the industry who tripped over the simplest rules of his own trade.</p><p name="4380" id="4380" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">If Dale Jackaman wants to be taken seriously, he has only one path forward: a public retraction and apology. Until then, the question remains — who the hell is this guy, and why did he think this was a good idea?</p></div></div></section>
