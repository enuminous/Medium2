JP Morgan is now eating its own tail, and I am very pleased to have been the feeder. I do believe that when you talk to a employee of a Chase Bank who is calling to inform you of the number that they must assign the case having heard from the consumer financial protection bureau, and when that person hears me verbalize a series of crimes that another financial institution has undertaken, that person is required by law to file an SAR The fact that the SAR will be filed by a Chase Bank employee against JP Morgan Private Banking is not my problem, but might be theirs? I offered JP Morgan the opportunity to extend me banking services as a high-value individual, and gave them very strong specifics about why I should be offered banking services, including a large line of credit. At no time did they treat me like a potential client, or give me any kind of dignity befitting my status. Usually, when a person calls a Bank and says they have struck at Rich and want to do banking services with that bank, the red carpet is rolled out. I am in tears when I consider how hard I have worked and how horribly JP Morgan has treated me. Jamie Dillon has a lot to answer for.</p></div></div></section>
