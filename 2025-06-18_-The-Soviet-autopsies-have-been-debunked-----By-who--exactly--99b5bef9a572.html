Let’s clarify:

<section name="45dc" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="4483" id="4483" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">&quot;The Soviet autopsies have been debunked&quot; -- By who, exactly? Because starting off a response with a blatant falsehood doesn&#39;t win friends. Thank you for your continued engagement, but I must be clear: at some point, the pursuit of “truth” turns into a defense of myth — not because the facts are lacking, but because they are persistently overwritten by counter-narratives that offer no evidence beyond speculation.</p><p name="947a" id="947a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s clarify:</p><p name="c750" id="c750" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hitler&#39;s dental remains were verified by the Soviets and corroborated decades later by French forensic scientists in 2017 using DNA and anatomical analysis of the jawbone and teeth. The match with Hitler’s known dental records — kept by his personal dentist — is conclusive.</p><p name="0fd5" id="0fd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The German court issued a death certificate because all intelligence, from multiple Allied services, confirmed his suicide. There was no body buried in the public square — but this does not imply escape. Bodies burn, especially when doused in petrol, and especially when ordered by a dictator paranoid about being put on display like Mussolini.</p><p name="6beb" id="6beb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The surgical escape theory — facial reconstruction, escape to Argentina, etc. — is not substantiated by any documented chain of custody, any verified witness, or any physical evidence. These stories emerge decades later, often from sources tied to Cold War disinformation campaigns.</p><p name="1efb" id="1efb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me be direct:</p><p name="ab0d" id="ab0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔹 The “multidisciplinary” rebuttal you’re asking for has already happened. Forensics, pathology, intelligence, dental anthropology, witness testimony — all converge. If you reject all of those simultaneously, you are no longer investigating, you are curating doubt.</p><p name="072f" id="072f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔹 The desire to “honor the six million” is noble, but misapplied here. Honoring the victims does not mean casting doubt on the documented suicide of the perpetrator — it means ensuring his ideology dies with him. And that happens through education, not endless conspiratorial what-ifs.</p><p name="4ece" id="4ece" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">🔹 Academic scholarship is authoritative when it is replicable, evidenced, and cross-validated. If we throw that out, we invite every tyrant to rewrite history in real-time.</p><p name="3bd5" id="3bd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So here’s my question for you:</p><p name="ffe2" id="ffe2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What evidence would falsify your belief?</p><p name="801f" id="801f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the answer is “none,” then this is no longer a discussion about history. It’s a discussion about faith — and dangerous faith at that.</p><p name="0230" id="0230" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As survivors fade from living memory, your insistence on doubt doesn’t serve the truth — it threatens it. And in the words of one survivor:</p><p name="b667" id="b667" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“To forget is to kill twice.”</p><p name="c87b" id="c87b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Let’s not forget. And let’s not replace the facts with shadows.</p></div></div></section>
