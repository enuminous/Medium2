They reflect deep reading—whether acknowledged or not.<br><br>I invite you to engage with the EFMW work directly. I believe we are standing at the same threshold, and clarity between thinkers matters more now than ever.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br><br>Ps, considering the fact that I am a federal whistleblower, and actually functionally broke, disabled, and being attacked, silence is in alignment with those who would destroy me. Please publish my work and release my name into the world, so that everybody may know that I created the new physics. I have actually written the main efmw equation on chalk on the ground in front of the physics building at University of california, davis. This work is out there, and gaining traction. You yourself have read it. I see no citations. The fact that I am not with letters after my name should not matter a wit. I am a neurodivergent genius who has cracked the code of the universe, and I need your immediate help, including financial support and assistance in protecting me from people who would have me killed because I have ratted them out for their massive crimes.</p></div></div></section>
