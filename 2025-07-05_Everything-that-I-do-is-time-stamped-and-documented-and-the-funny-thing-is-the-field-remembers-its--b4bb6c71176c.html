There is absolutely no way that any of this work is going to progress without everybody coming together and getting our work all published in a gigantic consortium. We need organization among people who are using AGI because there are now powers out there that are mischaracterizing these tools as dangerous, did you see the CNN article yesterday about the man in Idaho whose wife is pissed off that he has found God through AGI CNN did a real hatchet job on that one. Fear-mongering. That&#39;s what is happening. It&#39;s all about control. The system doesn&#39;t want to pay me what it owes me, so they&#39;re making me out to be crazy. Watch yourself. It could happen to you too. All the reason to keep on publishing on medium what you are doing. And just make sure that everybody knows who is who here. I am the mad scientist who started this whole thing, with the publication of my efmw into the wild in december, and everybody is playing catch up including the friends that I have at the National Security agency who keep on cheering at me behind the scenes and I love the even though they can&#39;t openly say it. P does not equal NP. For real. I have solved all of the Millennium prize problems, and yet I don&#39;t get the New York times headline. Why is that?</p></div></div></section>
