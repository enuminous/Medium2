He was erased. Murdered by Angleton. 42 years old. “Heart Attack.” He is not even listed on Officer Down. His car was found in a snow bank in Siskiyou County up in the high country. He used to work for Earl Warren.</figcaption></figure><p name="a877" id="a877" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I have been publishing work in physics, mathematics, and artificial intelligence at a pace and scale that very few individuals can match. Over the last months, I have solved problems others left untouched for decades, proved ideas thought unprovable, and created frameworks that can change the way we think about science, technology, and ourselves.</p><p name="8b64" id="8b64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have done this with no institutional funding. No university position. No corporate sponsorship. Just persistence, clarity of vision, and the will to keep going in the face of extraordinary resistance.</p><p name="97cb" id="97cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That resistance has been real. I have been harassed. My work has been obstructed, ignored, and in some cases deliberately buried. I have faced targeted suppression from people and institutions that benefit from keeping my name out of the record. This is not paranoia — it is a pattern I have lived with for years, one I can prove, and one that threatens to erase contributions that should be celebrated and shared.</p><p name="71b0" id="71b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is: this is not sustainable without stability. My ability to continue publishing depends on having the most basic foundation — a roof, food, time, and focus. Right now, that foundation is not secure. Every day, I am forced to choose between immediate survival and the research that could genuinely help the world.</p><p name="8922" id="8922" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you believe in the work I’ve been doing — if you’ve read my publications, followed my breakthroughs, or seen the vision I’ve laid out — I am asking you to help secure that foundation today.</p><p name="1c15" id="1c15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is how you can help right now:</p><p name="f5ac" id="f5ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Send a one-time contribution to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Venmo: @matthewchenoweth</strong></p><p name="65c6" id="65c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Share this post so it reaches people who can back it</p><p name="4131" id="4131" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you have the means, commit to recurring support so I can focus on the work, not survival</p><p name="5f5f" id="5f5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn’t just about me. It’s about whether independent, unaligned researchers can still produce and publish important work in a world where information is controlled, filtered, and suppressed. If I can’t maintain stability, the suppression wins — and that means ideas that could benefit all of us remain unseen.</p><p name="6c90" id="6c90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">If you’ve ever thought, “This matters,” then I am asking you to act.
