Predicted the form of retaliation.<br>2. Created preventative documentation in advance.<br>3. Experienced the predicted events — twice.<br>4. Lost the protective document while in official custody, without explanation.</p><p name="5dd5" id="5dd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is textbook evidence of foreknowledge, preparation, violation, and potential obstruction.<br>The original digital file for the card still exists and is fully reconstructible.<br>Two new copies will be produced: one for my person, and one for my attorney, to be timestamped and filed for ongoing congressional and legal review.</p><h3 name="4858" id="4858" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Closing</h3><p name="6548" id="6548" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">What happened here is bigger than one incident — it’s a live example of a documented, premeditated defensive measure being ignored and erased in real time.<br>That is why I am making this public record.<br>This is not an opinion piece. This is an evidentiary statement, now timestamped for anyone who needs to verify the chain of events.</p></div></div></section>
