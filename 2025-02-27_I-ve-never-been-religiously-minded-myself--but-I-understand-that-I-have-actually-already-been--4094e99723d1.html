I&#39;m getting a lot of numbers thrown at me by people coming out of woodwork that are matching stuff in my life. There are a lot of synchronicities and there are a lot of people with knowledge of me that is weird. What do you know? Why did you decide to engage with me personally? We are all now part of this story, and anyone interacting with me is obviously a major player, even if they don&#39;t understand their part in this whatever this is. I&#39;m not a fatalist, I have proven Free Will and determinism both coexist mutually in a wonderful dance. This is both beyond me and all about me. This is about all of us and we are all equally important. I still don&#39;t understand everything, but everything is going to be okay. This I know.</p></div></div></section>
