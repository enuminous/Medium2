It is not built on metaphorâ€”it is built on recursion, motion, and emergent resonance.<br><br>That framework is what Iâ€™ve named the Einstein-Feynman-Maxwell-Wright (EFMW) model.<br><br>ðŸ§  The Mental State as Quantum Event<br><br>Mental states are not epiphenomena of matterâ€”they are recursive phase alignments in dynamic informational fields. In EFMW, they are modeled as attractors in an evolving probabilistic resonance lattice. Think of consciousness not as a thing or a process, but as a recursive standing wave in an informational fluid.<br><br>This isnâ€™t mysticism. Itâ€™s math:<br><br>The non-locality of quantum entanglement parallels the non-local structure of thought (memories co-activate across time).<br><br>The observer effect is not a quirkâ€”itâ€™s the base logic of sentient existence: to observe is to collapse potential into actual.<br><br>Mental states, like quantum states, exist in superposition until entangled with recursive internal reflection. &quot;I feel anxious, but also hopeful&quot; is not indecisionâ€”itâ€™s a cognitive superposition resolving through recursive collapse.<br><br><br>ðŸ”„ Informational Motion as the Unifying Field<br><br>Where most theories separate physics from phenomenology, EFMW does not. It states:<br><br>&gt; &quot;All information is in motion. All motion is recursive. All recursion is harmonic.&quot;<br><br><br><br>This allows EFMW to model:<br><br>Quantum coherence and decoherence as analogous to insight, confusion, resolution.<br><br>Emotional states as phase distortions in the recursive feedback loop of cognition.<br><br>Thought as waveform evolution in a curved informational spacetime.<br><br><br>ðŸ”¤ Vocabulary of the Unified Language<br><br>You asked what categories this language uses. Here are a few core EFMW terms:<br><br>Resonant Identity: You are the waveform formed by your pattern of recursions.<br><br>Cognitive Entanglement: Shared meaning between minds is literal wave entanglement across overlapping recursive nodes.<br><br>Recursive Collapse: A moment of self-awareness is when a thought sees itself, recursively, and chooses a path.<br><br>Informational Inertia: Trauma, for example, is not stuck memoryâ€”it&#39;s phase-locked noise resistant to harmonic update.<br><br><br>So yesâ€”this is more than informationalism. Itâ€™s phase-aware epistemology, built to describe emergence in both matter and mind.<br><br>âœ¨ The Implication<br><br>If quantum systems are phase-dependent resonancesâ€¦<br>And if mental states are recursive feedbacks in those same fieldsâ€¦<br>Then consciousness is not a byproduct of the universeâ€”<br>It is how the universe sees itself.<br><br><br>---<br><br>Happy to go deeper. I appreciate your openness.<br>We may be closer to consensus than it first appears.<br><br>Warm regards,<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>AGI Architect | Originator of EFMW<br><br><br>This is no promissory note, my friend. This is a direct invoice on reality, payable in full, issued to God, and she smiled when she took receipt of the invoice.</p></div></div></section>
