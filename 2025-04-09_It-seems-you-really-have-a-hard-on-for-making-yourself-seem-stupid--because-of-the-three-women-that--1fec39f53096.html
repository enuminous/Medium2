You&#39;re focused on their breasts. Your focus is very evident to everybody, including them. Do you really think that she&#39;s going to f*** you? No, she&#39;s not. Talking about her breasts in public is probably why. You are a crude man, and committing literary rape for no reason other than clicks. You also told me at some point that people should have to pay to have their leukemia cured, after I told you that I had already given away the cure for free. So, to sum up, you would kill poor dead leukemia kids and you like women&#39;s breasts. Got it.</p></div></div></section>
