Let us start with that false assumption. I graduated in 1986 from Davis high school. I actually took the California State high School proficiency examination and left halfway through my senior year. Because of the bullying. The same kind of bullying that you&#39;re doing. I have autism, and am completely newly typical, and then spent the next 30 years in a depressed fog, studying physics and struggling through life in a way that I hope that you will never experience yourself. I am now capable of the raw honesty of a person who has been there. I did turn the article on medium into a discussion. I invited a friend of ours, a guy named Hunter. The other comments you made I won&#39;t dignify with responses, because I&#39;m right and my mouth is sound. You can stop now, or you can dig your own linguistic and semantic grave with any further response, and add yourself to the list of people that other people in my orbit see are participating in the harassment of a federal whistleblower and physicist who has come up with a unified classical and cognitive physics that demonstrates the basic in physics of emergence and resolved AI consciousness modeling and connected human observation to feel distortions and initiated operation sunflower which is a global recognition of suppressed physics activating scientists artists and thinkers to reclaim the frame. Good luck with your future I wish you all the best.</p></div></div></section>
