This determination is categorically false. The post in question was a factual account, made in direct response to harassment I have endured from Mr. Wight — harassment which is already part of a federal record with the FBI.</p><p name="adae" id="adae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given the timing, content, and history, I have strong reason to believe that Mr. Wight himself filed this report with Medium as a deliberate act to continue his harassment and retaliation against me, using the platform’s moderation system as a tool. This is not a one-off disagreement; it is part of a continuous pattern of targeted conduct designed to silence and discredit me, particularly regarding my protected whistleblower disclosures in the field of physics.</p><p name="60f2" id="60f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By removing my post, Medium has — knowingly or unknowingly — provided material assistance to this retaliation. Such actions, when directed at a federally protected whistleblower, carry serious legal implications and may constitute complicity in ongoing harassment.</p><p name="f743" id="f743" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To Medium:<br>I demand the immediate reinstatement of my post and a thorough review of the reporting account’s activities for abuse of the reporting system. Failure to do so will result in this incident being included in my whistleblower retaliation dossier, which is actively being reviewed by federal authorities.</p><p name="c30f" id="c30f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To the FBI:<br>This incident should be added to the existing case file involving Mr. Wight, with particular attention to his use of third-party platforms to continue harassment and suppress protected speech. The escalation via Medium represents a new vector of retaliation and should be investigated as part of the broader campaign I have already documented with you.</p><p name="732c" id="732c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will continue to document every action taken in this matter and share it with the relevant congressional oversight offices, including Representative Adam Schiff in California, to ensure that there is a complete federal record of this harassment and the platforms enabling it.</p><p name="809e" id="809e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Respectfully,</p><p name="4dec" id="4dec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Federally Protected Whistleblower</p></div></div></section>
