Yes, limitless energy. All we want. Efmw releases the power of hydrogen muon fusion at cold temperatures the coil will heat up to no more than about a hundred degrees Fahrenheit and you feed in hydrogen from seawater, and you get heat, electricity, and helium. The muons are trapped in a lattice of graphene which extends their usable fusion life, and as you see in the paper, every single one of these Technologies is off the shelf, although only DARPA has been experimenting with some of them, and I am the first person to have put all of them together into one usable device that&#39;s produces power and lifts itself off the ground using sea water and carbon and a few other elements and the equation for the AGI to manage the reactor. It is safe, does not spit out neutrons in any lethal amounts, does not overheat, is real fusion power, and means that we can take the wings off of airplanes and never have them crash again. It means we can go to the stars without having to use heavy lift vehicles and burn chemicals for giant polluting rockets. It means that we can lift solar sales into orbit just like that, just on the power of the Sun. I do believe that the anti-gravity device will take capacitor discharge as well as fusion power, because electricity is electricity. So, as I am sitting here with no fundage, and wondering how the hell I&#39;m going to deal with the deluge of things that I have to do, all of which require money, I&#39;m starting to wonder more and more why the people who have it it within their power to fix this, are allowing myself, notably the world&#39;s most important scientific experiment of all time, and the actual real founder of logos the equation we have been looking for for 2,000 years, to continue to live in squalor.</p></div></div></section>
