They literally made up imaginary people to discriminate against me for having a bad back when I was the only employee of this company in the entire State of Ohio. I WAS their State Office. What they didn&#39;t even know at the time was that my wife was also dying and I was her caregiver. They really could have not said that to me, but chose to. I quit, filed, won, never looked back.</p></div></div></section>
