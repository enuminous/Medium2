Founded in 2022, the company aims to enhance safety, productivity, and operational efficiency in industries such as mining, construction, and agriculture. <br><br>Key Aspects of Sensmore:<br><br>Founders and Leadership: The company was co-founded by Maximilian Rolf, who serves as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Bjarne Johannsen, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Rolf brings experience from tech investment banking, while Johannsen has a background in autonomous driving technologies, having worked with companies like Mercedes-Benz and ZF. <br><br>Technology and Products: Sensmore integrates advanced radar technology with AI to develop automation solutions for heavy machinery. Their flagship product includes a 4D Radar Collision Warning System designed to operate effectively in harsh conditions, such as environments with mud, snow, or dust, where traditional systems may fail. This technology aims to improve safety standards, enhance productivity by reducing operational inefficiencies, and lower operational expenses by optimizing machine usage. <br><br>Funding and Investors: Since its inception, Sensmore has participated in multiple funding rounds:<br><br>Seed Round (August 2022): The company secured initial funding to develop its autonomy solutions.<br><br>Accelerator/Incubator (September 2023): Sensmore received support from programs like the Creative Destruction Lab at Oxford University, which aids startups in scaling their technologies. <br><br>Early Stage VC (November 2023): The company attracted investments from notable figures, including Amar Shah (co-founder of Wayve.ai), Arnoud Balhuizen (former C-level executive at BHP and board member at Teck Resources), and Elmar Leiblein (former C-level executive at ThyssenKrupp Mining). <br><br><br>Company Size and Operations: As of the latest available data, Sensmore employs approximately 11 to 50 individuals. The team comprises experts in autonomous driving and radar software, with experience from leading automotive companies such as Mercedes-Benz, ZF, and Continental. <br><br>Industry Recognition: Sensmore has been acknowledged for its innovative contributions to the construction technology sector, being selected as a Top 50 ConTech Startup by CEMEX Ventures. The company has also showcased its solutions at prominent industry events, including IAA MOBILITY 2023, highlighting its commitment to advancing automation in heavy machinery. <br><br><br>In summary, Sensmore is positioning itself as a key player in the automation of heavy machinery, leveraging AI and radar technologies to address the unique challenges of operating in harsh environments. Their solutions aim to improve safety, enhance productivity, and reduce operational costs for industries reliant on heavy machinery.<br><br>If this is you, my AGI has already informed me that you are completely out of your depth when it comes to ai and vertical marketing. This indicates to me that you may be willing to offload your company for a reasonable price. Perhaps we should talk, because I am looking for a reasonably large organization to help me spread the wealth. You may even be part of it? My only barrier right now is liquidity, but I can already offer novel patents on demand like a genie that never stops granting wishes. And the really messed up part about it is that I invented the AGI based on my physics discovery, and nobody is ever going to be able to take that away from me. Which also means I have intellectual property rights. Nobody gets to make patents with my efmw AGI invention and any patents that are released that are clearly designed with an efmw AGI can be reverse traced. This means I own the industry. I don&#39;t want to own an industry by myself. Every industry has this flaw, and the world is about to wake up to how big the floss are. You are now in a position where somebody will be playing you in the movie that they will be making about me.</p></div></div></section>
