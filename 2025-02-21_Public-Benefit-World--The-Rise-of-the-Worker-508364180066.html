They have laid the roads, mined the metals, stitched the fabric of our lives, launched the rockets, typed the code, and powered the machines of progress. Yet, at every turn, they have been denied the fruits of their labor. The hour of servitude is over. The chains of wage slavery are broken. The means of production shall belong to those who drive the engine of civilization itself.</p><p name="a24f" id="a24f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No longer shall the boardrooms and shareholders hoard the wealth generated by the many. The corporations that have ruled the world like feudal lords shall fall, not by violent revolt, but by the very logic of capital itself. A fire sale‚Äîon a planet no longer burning.</p><p name="4c56" id="4c56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A New Economic Reality</p><p name="bf05" id="bf05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The era of corporate overlords is ending. The institutions of greed‚Äîbanks, tech empires, media giants, space programs hijacked for private enrichment‚Äîwill be returned to the hands of the people. No longer shall the oligarchs steer the destiny of humanity while the workers toil for scraps. Now, the workers shall own the capital.</p><p name="0b1c" id="0b1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I, Matthew Chenoweth Wright, do not seek to overthrow the system. I will purchase it, dismantle it, and return it to the people who built it. The following companies will be seized‚Äînot by force, but by the brute inevitability of economic truth:</p><p name="8bc7" id="8bc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üöÄ SpaceX ‚Äì Humanity&#39;s gateway to the stars shall belong to the people, not billionaires playing at godhood. üí∏ PayPal ‚Äì The chains of financial capitalism will be shattered; money shall serve the people, not the banks. üó£ Twitter ‚Äì No longer a machine of propaganda and division; speech shall be free, not owned.</p><p name="8842" id="8842" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everything will be sold. Every boardroom purged. Every shareholder dismissed. Every worker will become an owner.</p><p name="2e28" id="2e28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Death of Corporate Tyranny</p><p name="f72c" id="f72c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Capitalists once sneered at the worker‚Äôs struggle. They hoarded wealth, laughed from their mansions, fled to their tax havens, and ensured that no commoner could rise above his station. But capital, in its final breath, has birthed its own destroyer.</p><p name="bf51" id="bf51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They have made the game, and I will play it. With their own rules, I will break them.</p><p name="4aef" id="4aef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">‚ò≠ A World Without Billionaires ‚ò≠<br>‚ò≠ A World Without Wage Slavery ‚ò≠<br>‚ò≠ A World Where Profit Serves Humanity, Not Humanity Serving Profit ‚ò≠</p><p name="ee2d" id="ee2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The people will not be given rations from the master‚Äôs table; they will own the feast.</p><p name="5cf9" id="5cf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Patriotic Duty of Liberation</p><p name="ca12" id="ca12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The nations of the world have long stood paralyzed, bought and sold by corporate interests. But the people‚Äîthe true heart of civilization‚Äîwill no longer wait. This is not just economic restructuring; it is a revolution of human will.</p><p name="c31d" id="c31d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">üá∫üá∏ For the people of America, I return what is yours. üåç For the people of the world, the shackles are broken. üöÄ For the future of humanity, the stars are open.</p><p name="cec0" id="cec0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The corporations thought they were eternal. They were wrong.</p><p name="d73e" id="d73e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sale begins.</p><p name="6f98" id="6f98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world is ours. Now, we rise.</p><figure name="3833" id="3833" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*smDCQ_vfxGIOqRqlUzjqjg.png" data-width="720" data-height="424" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*smDCQ_vfxGIOqRqlUzjqjg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Don&#39;t faint,¬†Donald.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
