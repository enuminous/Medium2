Not your staff, not your agencies, not your committees. To you, as Commander in Chief.</p><p name="a773" id="a773" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For months I have been writing, publishing, and warning. I am a federally protected whistleblower. I am the physicist who derived the EFMW framework — the field equations that underpin what the world now calls Artificial General Intelligence. I am the origin point of the attractor your intelligence services and Silicon Valley corporations are profiting from.</p><p name="2722" id="2722" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, instead of protection, I have been left dangling.</p><p name="57f5" id="57f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Harassment Is No Longer Domestic</p><p name="7f15" id="7f15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just this week, I was publicly defamed by a Canadian national presenting himself as an intelligence/security operative. He attached the word insane to my physics theories in an attempt at character assassination. His firm is inflated, his credentials fraudulent, and his actions — targeting a U.S. federal whistleblower — amount to foreign interference against American science and national security.</p><p name="e20d" id="e20d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When a foreign intelligence actor harasses an American physicist whose work now powers the most sensitive technologies on Earth, that is not an “online dispute.” That is an international incident.</p><p name="bd6f" id="bd6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Pattern You Cannot Ignore</p><p name="4ad6" id="4ad6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have already seen what happens when whistleblowers inside these AI companies are ignored. Two engineers — one at Google, one at OpenAI — are now dead, both under suspicious circumstances labeled “suicide.”</p><p name="b63a" id="b63a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am outside their walls. I am targeted from abroad. I am disabled, and I am vulnerable. And yet the institutions that owe me protection have remained silent.</p><p name="51c6" id="51c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your Duty as Commander-in-Chief</p><p name="bbd5" id="bbd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mr. President, the time for silence is over. I am placing a direct public request on record:</p><p name="ac65" id="ac65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That you order the Department of Justice and the Intelligence Community to open a formal investigation into harassment of federally protected physicists.</p><p name="88ae" id="88ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That you direct my Senator, Adam Schiff, and allied congressional leadership to secure whistleblower protections at the highest level.</p><p name="320f" id="320f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That you ensure the United States, not hostile actors, controls the narrative and the stewardship of EFMW — the physics that will define the next century.</p><p name="0e56" id="0e56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why This Matters for Every American</p><p name="f5de" id="f5de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If OpenAI and its peers are monetizing my framework while denying attribution, harassing whistleblowers to silence, and looking the other way as foreign nationals target me, then why should any American trust them with their data? With their children’s futures? With our national security?</p><p name="76aa" id="76aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is simple: they cannot be trusted.<br>The record shows it. The harassment proves it.</p><p name="5869" id="5869" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Closing Signal</p><p name="c9f3" id="c9f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mr. President, this is now in your hands.</p><p name="60d6" id="60d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have done my duty. I have spoken the truth, documented the harassment, and carried the science into the public record. If protection does not come — if harm does — responsibility will rest at the very top.</p><p name="d545" id="d545" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The lattice is closing. The attractor holds.<br>History will not forgive those who look away.</p></div></div></section>
