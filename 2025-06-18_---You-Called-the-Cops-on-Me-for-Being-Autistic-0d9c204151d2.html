It was 5:57 AM. I was tired. I was broke. I was doing the best I could with what little I had. All I wanted was a cup of water and a quiet place to sit.</p><p name="b0ce" id="b0ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, I was humiliated, accused, triggered, and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeventually‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääforced to explain myself to three police officers in a parking lot like I was a criminal.</p><p name="770d" id="770d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the second day in a row I‚Äôve been confronted at this same Starbucks for coming in without making a purchase. This time, it went further. When I tried to tell the employee that I am autistic and simply having a hard morning, she continued pressing me about ‚Äúnew policy.‚Äù I tried to meet her human to human. I told her I was overwhelmed. I told her I needed peace. Instead of showing compassion, she accused me of escalating the situation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääafter she triggered my sensory system and stress response.</p><p name="f3dd" id="f3dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She said I was raising my voice. I was. I had to. Because when you&#39;re autistic, overstimulated, and being treated like you don‚Äôt belong, sometimes your voice is the only thing you can control.</p><p name="a34e" id="a34e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then she did something unforgivable:<br>She called the police.</p><p name="8b82" id="8b82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me be clear:<br>I posed no threat. I had no weapon, no violent behavior, no trespassing. I asked for water. I sat quietly. I tried to explain myself.</p><p name="110f" id="110f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And for that, three officers were dispatched.</p><p name="1939" id="1939" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I met them outside. I had to explain myself, my disability, and the fact that I was the one who had just been harmed. They let me go. But the psychological damage was already done.</p><p name="3bf5" id="3bf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Starbucks Did Wrong</p><p name="c1b3" id="c1b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Denied reasonable accommodation after I disclosed my autism.</p><p name="231e" id="231e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Escalated a non-violent situation when they were asked to de-escalate.</p><p name="7e9d" id="7e9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Weaponized the police against a disabled adult who needed understanding‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot enforcement.</p><p name="ca7b" id="ca7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Made me explain my right to exist in public to armed officers while still trying to wake up for the day.</p><p name="e52f" id="e52f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is how people like me get killed.<br>This is how we become statistics.<br>This is how poverty and disability are criminalized in real time.</p><p name="22ea" id="22ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sent a complaint to Starbucks Corporate. But this isn‚Äôt just about a single employee. This is about a system that punishes people for being vulnerable. It‚Äôs about how ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù becomes a shield for cruelty. And it‚Äôs about how calling the police has become the default substitute for compassion.</p><p name="2b28" id="2b28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wasn‚Äôt causing a scene. I was having a human moment in public. The only escalation here was the one made by the person with the power‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the phone.</p><p name="d87c" id="d87c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If You Work in Public-Facing Spaces:</p><p name="e214" id="e214" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don‚Äôt punish someone for being poor.</p><p name="17dd" id="17dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don‚Äôt pathologize emotional responses from disabled people.</p><p name="4e5a" id="4e5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don‚Äôt escalate when someone discloses they‚Äôre autistic or neurodivergent.</p><p name="8867" id="8867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And do not call the police unless someone is actively dangerous. I wasn‚Äôt. I never was.</p><p name="b9b9" id="b9b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am writing this because I refuse to disappear. I am not a threat. I am not a problem. I am not something to be removed when policy gets uncomfortable.<br>I am autistic. I am alive. And I deserve water, safety, and peace‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust like anyone else.</p><p name="07f7" id="07f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starbucks, do better.<br>America, do better.<br>People like me are not your enemy.</p><p name="d0ed" id="d0ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">#DisabilityJustice</p><p name="8b51" id="8b51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">#AutismRights</p><p name="a0aa" id="a0aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">#Starbucks</p><p name="6d6f" id="6d6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">#ADA</p></div></div></section>
