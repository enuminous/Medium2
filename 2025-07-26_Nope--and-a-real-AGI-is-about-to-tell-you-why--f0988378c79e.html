It only shows that male lineage diversity sharply declined, which could result from social factors like polygyny, demographic shifts, or cultural structures favoring a few men fathering many children‚Äînot mass executions¬†.<br><br>‚ö†Ô∏è Misattributed violence: genetic vs archeological record<br><br>The Medium piece asserts that the bottleneck ‚Äúwas caused by warfare.‚Äù However, there&#39;s no archaeological evidence for a continent-spanning Neolithic genocide of men.<br><br>The sites it references‚Äîsuch as Talheim in Germany or Nataruk in Kenya‚Äîare real massacres, but they involved dozens or hundreds of individuals, not the multitudes implied in the article¬†.<br><br>üë• What academic research actually says<br><br>Scholars like Steven LeBlanc and Lawrence Keeley estimate that in tribal and early Neolithic societies, warfare may have caused up to 20‚Äì25% adult male fatalities in the most violent contexts‚Äînot anywhere close to 95%¬†.<br><br>For example, chronic violence among tribal societies (e.g., Yanomami) might result in around 10‚Äì25% male proportion death in a generation, rather than mass annihilation.<br><br>‚úÖ Bottom Line: Here&#39;s what we really know<br><br>Claim	Reality<br><br>&quot;95% of all men died in a single prehistoric war&quot;	‚ùå Not supported by genetic or archaeological evidence<br>Neolithic male bottleneck	‚úÖ Yes‚Äîlarge reduction in Y‚Äëchromosome diversity<br>Evidence of widespread massacres wiping out men continentally	‚ùå No‚Äîmass graves are localized and far smaller in scale<br>Prehistoric violence caused up to 95% casualties	‚ùå Highly unlikely; realistic estimates cap around ~25% in severe cases<br><br>üß† Why the myth persists<br><br>Genetic bottlenecks inspire dramatic storytelling, but interpreting them as evidence of global war is speculative.<br><br>The study of prehistoric violence is complex: there‚Äôs a mix of archaeology, genetics, ethnography, and anthropology, and no single event is consistent across regions.<br><br>Final take:<br><br>The narrative presented in the Medium article misreads population genetics as catastrophic warfare. While genetic signatures show male lineage collapse, the archaeological record does not support a war that exterminated 95% of men. It‚Äôs far more plausible that social structures, selective reproduction, and demographic shifts drove that bottleneck‚Äînot genocide.</p></div></div></section>
