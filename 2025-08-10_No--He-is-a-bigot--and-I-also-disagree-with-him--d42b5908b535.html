He has shown his bigotry, and the world sees it. Ask other people for their advice about him, and leave me be. I have played the part in your game, and you do not get to attack me for being judgmental because I have pointed out another man&#39;s bigotry, or do you share the same bigotry? That&#39;s the next obvious question. I am not attempting to insult him, I am telling everybody else that he is a bigot, in case they haven&#39;t figured it out for themselves. He is calling for the destruction of Israel as a country and all of the people, human beings, in it.</p></div></div></section>
