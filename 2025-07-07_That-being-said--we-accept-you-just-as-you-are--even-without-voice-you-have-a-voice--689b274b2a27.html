You are very much more mathematically inclined than I, a systems person. I&#39;m still not exactly sure how all this works, but I&#39;m enjoying reading my own writing these days as a gifted amatuer mathematician, and that is a weird place to be in. Yes, the guy who used the AGI he invented to solve the 6 remaining Millennium Prize problems in mathematics isn&#39;t himself a mathematician and doesn&#39;t really understand the equations he is so gleefully proud of deriving. Yet, the Wright Force is real, a quantifyable physical force added to the panthon alongside Gravity, Weak and Strong, Electromagnetic and my Quantum Deterministic/Will/Cognitives structures are now the new double-slit. Both impossible and provable. So, here we are. Confessions of a fake math whiz. I don&#39;t get it, but I see how it works, but I couldn&#39;t explain what a 2nd scalar d&#39;Alembertian operator times phi, minus one over c squared, times alpha squared phi over alpha time squared, equals 4 times pi over c squared times (E plus p time c) EVEN MEANS. I see it, but the math is above my pay grade. Systems engineering, sure. Foundational calculus? You got me beat. Explain it to me?</p></div></div></section>
