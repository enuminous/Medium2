The fallout from the disappearance is the story that he wanted to have happen and it happened the way it did. If he exposed any problems in the industry itself, that may have been accidental or that may have been his purpose, but this is a field that includes the fact that this will always have happened and it will always be a mystery. That is the greatest accomplishment that he got out of it, not killing a bunch of people. Anyone can do that, but disappearing a bunch of people and an airplane on purpose is not something that any sane person ever considers doing, and so this is a man who decided to show his Insanity to the world, and let us all live with it as he died with it.</p></div></div></section>
