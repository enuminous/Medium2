This is not ethical. It leaves the public reading her comments with the impression that my work is not complete when it is. She has been given multiple opportunities to refine her statement and to point out what she considers to be falsifiable in my work and has not. Science works on ethical validation not refusal to come to the table. Telling me that she has a PhD in psychology does not address the fact that she has refused to actually publicly address my work and has chosen to make public statements refusing to engage with it. This leaves a bad taste in everyone&#39;s mouth and is designed to give the impression that my work is controversial, that there is unsettled science about it or it is in any way riddled with gaps as she puts it. the efmw field equations are complete the mathematics are proven and cross-verifiable and I have indeed solved all of the remaining Millennium prize problems in mathematics as well as formulating a brand new foundational physics including the discovery of a new physical law.</p></div></div></section>
