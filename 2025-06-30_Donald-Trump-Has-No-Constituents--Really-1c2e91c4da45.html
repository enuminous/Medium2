Not even the ones who chant his name. Not even the ones who weep when he descends from his Boeing like a spray-tanned messiah wrapped in golf slacks. If one were inclined toward precision, one might say he doesn’t represent anything at all — not a class, not a cause, not a coherent ideology. He is, in the Swiftian sense, a man inflated not by virtue or vision, but by a surfeit of hot air and the gullibility of fools.</p><p name="51e1" id="51e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One must look beyond the red caps and the mob pageantry. What does he <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">stand</em> for? Not the working class, whose wages he crushed under deregulation and tax cuts for the feudal lords. Not the military, whose loyalty he tried to conscript in service of a tantrum. Not the church, whose teachings he butchers with every breathless syllable of narcissistic incoherence. His so-called base is not a constituency. It is a hallucination. It is a cargo cult of grievance wrapped in the aesthetics of decline.</p><p name="c14a" id="c14a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He has no policies, only performative cruelty. No vision, only vengeance. No ideas, only the endless groaning echo of his own name bouncing through marbled halls built by better men. And let us not mistake noise for substance. The chants, the flags, the bellowing tweets — these are not signs of power. They are the death rattle of a collapsing fantasy: that a nation can be governed by a man whose entire life has been one long, gold-plated bankruptcy.</p><p name="8fcf" id="8fcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A man who hires lawyers like most men buy socks — in bulk, knowing they will soon be discarded. A man who confuses the nuclear codes with Nielsen ratings. Who would sell the Pentagon for a hotel chain if only someone made him an offer. A man who tried to rule by brand alone, forgetting that “TRUMP” scrawled across a steak, a building, or a baseball cap is not governance. It is merchandising.</p><p name="0730" id="0730" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No, he does not have constituents. He has <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">customers</em>. And even they are beginning to realize the returns are defective.</p><p name="8b33" id="8b33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In truth, Donald Trump is a reflection of nothing more than America’s unresolved appetite for spectacle. He is the Gilded Age rebooted as reality television. He is a Jonathan Swift character without the wit — a walking, sniffing, gesticulating satire of himself, if only he had the decency to know it.</p><p name="a867" id="a867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let us treat him as such. Not as a politician. Not as a leader. Not as a danger, even — though he is dangerous — but as a joke whose punchline is now five years late and has already been booed offstage.</p><p name="ccb8" id="ccb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His rallies are not gatherings of citizens. They are the final episodes of a cancelled series, filmed before a dwindling live studio audience who still hopes the laugh track will save them from the void.</p><p name="54ee" id="54ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He has no constituents.<br> He has <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">marks</em>.</p><p name="d8d4" id="d8d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the con is nearly spent.</p><p name="6e96" id="6e96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">America deserves better than this bleating void wrapped in a red tie. America, if it wishes to endure, must recognize that power without principle is not patriotism. It is farce.</p><p name="cbe3" id="cbe3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And Donald J. Trump is not a president.<br> He is a farce in a suit.</p><p name="2f43" id="2f43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">— Matthew Wright</p></div></div></section>
