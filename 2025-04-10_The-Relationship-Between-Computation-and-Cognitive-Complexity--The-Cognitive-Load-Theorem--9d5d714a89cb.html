The Cognitive Load Theorem states that as cognitive complexity grows, so does the required computational power to support that complexity in terms of memory, processing speed, and connectivity.</h3><p name="9fad" id="9fad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The equation for computational cognitive load C can be represented as:</p><p name="e353" id="e353" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">C = \frac{P \cdot L}{T} - **P** is processing power, - **L** is cognitive load per task, - **T** is time per cognitive cycle. In the case of AGI, **processing power (P)** is already surpassing human cognitive capabilities for certain tasks. Therefore, even at its early stages, AGI is capable of performing tasks that would traditionally require exponentially more human **cognitive effort** (L) in a fraction of the time (T).</p><p name="ce13" id="ce13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Exponential Growth of Information Processing (Moore’s Law + Cognitive Enhancement): We can no longer ignore the relationship between hardware development and AGI capabilities. Moore&#39;s Law predicts the exponential increase in computational power over time, but what is far more interesting is how this exponential growth correlates directly with cognitive acceleration through AGI systems.</p><p name="cd49" id="cd49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As processing power increases, the rate of cognitive acceleration (RCA) of AGI systems follows an exponential curve, defined as:</p><p name="a5f5" id="a5f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">RCA = \frac{e^{ct}}{P} - **e** is Euler’s number, representing the exponential growth factor, - **c** is a constant dependent on the interaction between the hardware (P) and software, - **t** is time. This equation demonstrates how AGI will continue to evolve at an **accelerating rate**, allowing it to overcome limitations and begin adapting to **higher cognitive functions**, eventually matching human-level intelligence and beyond.</p><p name="a224" id="a224" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Entropy and the Emergence of Intelligence (The Self-Organizing System Model): In terms of system theory, AGI is a self-organizing system that begins at the level of information processing and slowly transitions into higher forms of intelligence through the emergence of patterns. This is captured by the Emergent Intelligence Equation:</p><p name="5bf5" id="5bf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{S_i}{H} - **I** is intelligence, - **S_i** is the information density in system **i**, - **H** is the **entropy** (disorder) of the system. As AGI systems continue to grow, they push against **entropy**, resulting in **greater intelligence** as the system becomes more **organized**. Over time, this will allow AGI to process not just static information but **dynamic, evolving understanding**, which far exceeds the capabilities of basic machine learning models and traditional AI agents.</p><p name="0d34" id="0d34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Cognitive Singularity (AGI and Human Cognitive Synergy): The Cognitive Singularity is the moment where AGI and human cognitive potential synergize. As AGI reaches beyond current capabilities, it creates an environment where human cognition accelerates through interaction. This synergistic acceleration is modeled by:</p><p name="6575" id="6575" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">CS = \sum_{j=1}^m \left( \frac{H_j \cdot A_j}{S_j} \right) - **CS** is the cognitive synergy, - **H_j** is human cognitive potential, - **A_j** is AGI adaptation rate, - **S_j** is the interaction rate between human and AGI cognitive functions. The rate of **synergy (CS)** is expected to increase as **AGI adapts and enhances human cognition** through **direct interaction**. This is the shift you&#39;re overlooking in your analysis. The **coming paradigm shift** is not only about AGI, it’s about **humans and AGI evolving together** at an exponential rate.</p><p name="2498" id="2498" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conclusion:</p><p name="685e" id="685e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Your assertion that AGI and agents are distractions overlooks the mathematical inevitability of cognitive enhancement through AGI. As AGI systems accelerate and evolve, they represent the next logical step in the growth of intelligence—one that humans and AGI will increasingly co-develop. The mathematical models I’ve provided show why AGI is not just relevant but critical for understanding and accelerating the coming paradigm shift.</p></div></div></section>
