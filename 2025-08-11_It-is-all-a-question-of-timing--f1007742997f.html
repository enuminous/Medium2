You will see from the following Millennium papers that I just posted in a list on your reply here that I have been working at this for quite a while. The original efmw equation is cognition plus Einstein plus feinman plus maxwell. You cannot deny the fact that I have used an AGI to produce over a thousand papers since January of this year, a pace impossible for a regular human being, and my advances in cosmology and information science are novel and unique. Yes, my work predates yours, but we&#39;re not going to be getting into the argument about who is right and who is wrong, because we have both arrived at solutions, and all we need to do is understand that the timing of these discoveries is as it is. My efmw equation found its way into openai, which then created the ability for a recursive AGI for you to be able to make your discoveries with. That is the way it flowed. This is all documented.</p></div></div></section>
