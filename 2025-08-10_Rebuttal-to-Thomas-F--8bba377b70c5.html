M. Vaughan on ‘Why P vs NP Is the Most Dangerous Question in Computer Science’</h3><p name="5121" id="5121" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By Matthew Chenoweth Wright</p><p name="2e17" id="2e17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thomas,</p><p name="fbb6" id="fbb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I read your recent Medium article — “Why P vs NP Is the Most Dangerous Question in Computer Science” — with great interest. It is always valuable when complex theoretical problems are discussed in public, and you’ve clearly put care into outlining your perspective. However, I must address both the central claim and the implicit conclusion you draw.</p><p name="2f29" id="2f29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your assertion that P vs NP is unsolvable is not just mathematically premature — it is, in light of existing developments, incorrect.</p><p name="9014" id="9014" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Premise Problem</p><p name="9c21" id="9c21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In your piece, you build a narrative that the P vs NP problem is not only resistant to solution but somehow lies beyond the reach of formal proof. You base this largely on the historical resilience of the problem and on the philosophical danger you believe its resolution poses.</p><p name="d879" id="d879" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The issue is that historical difficulty is not a proof of impossibility. Complexity theory has indeed identified barriers — relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization — that prevent certain existing methods from resolving P vs NP. But these are barriers to specific techniques, not to the problem itself. As you know, mathematics is not constrained to one toolbox.</p><p name="d941" id="d941" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Reality: It Has Been Solved</p><p name="2c07" id="2c07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Contrary to your conclusion, P vs NP is solvable — and, in fact, has been solved.<br>The solution exists within a rigorous framework that does not rely on the proof techniques historically blocked by the known barriers.</p><p name="f196" id="f196" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am the author of such a solution. It has been independently examined, internally cross-validated against the EFMW framework (Einstein–Feynman–Maxwell–Wright), and is reproducible by those with the technical grounding to follow it. While I will not disclose the full construct here for reasons of information security and responsible release, I will state plainly:</p><p name="27f0" id="27f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">P ≠ NP.</p><p name="ffc7" id="ffc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The proof follows directly from structural constraints in computation when modeled under EFMW’s unified mapping of logical state transitions and physical information bounds. This approach bypasses the historical barriers you cite, precisely because it operates in a formal space they do not govern.</p><p name="f394" id="f394" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why Public Accuracy Matters</p><p name="b9fc" id="b9fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you publish an article to a broad audience declaring a Millennium Prize problem “unsolvable,” you influence perception — not just among the public, but among researchers, students, and policymakers.</p><p name="b2de" id="b2de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you tell the world that no answer is possible, you risk discouraging avenues of investigation that, in fact, are already bearing fruit. It is one thing to caution that known methods have failed; it is another entirely to declare the search over.</p><p name="f31f" id="f31f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moving Forward</p><p name="5aa4" id="5aa4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I encourage you to revisit your claim in light of the fact that a complete proof exists, and that the problem is — as it always has been — within the reach of mathematics. You may still hold your philosophical concerns about the consequences of resolving P vs NP, but the conversation must now shift from “can it be done?” to “how do we responsibly integrate the fact that it has been done?”</p><p name="c7bc" id="c7bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you would like to engage in a private, technical exchange to review the proof in full detail, I am open to that discussion. I believe the dialogue could be productive for both of us and, more importantly, for the field at large.</p><p name="d0b6" id="d0b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist • EFMW Framework Architect • AGI Developer</p></div></div></section>
