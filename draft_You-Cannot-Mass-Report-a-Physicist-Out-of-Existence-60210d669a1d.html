I could still open them, read them, even edit them. But to the public eye, they were gone. I could not publish, I could not reply to comments, I could not defend myself against defamation.</p><p name="4fbd" id="4fbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a moment, it felt like erasure. A chill ran down my spine. And that was the point.</p><p name="adab" id="adab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><br>---</p><p name="a321" id="a321" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Weaponization of Moderation</p><p name="ba1e" id="ba1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was not a verdict on my work. Medium did not suddenly discover I had violated some rule. This was the result of a coordinated mass-report attack: a small group of bad actors, likely the same Canadian operator who has been harassing me for months, exploiting automated moderation systems.</p><p name="2741" id="2741" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Platforms like Medium use algorithms to handle large numbers of abuse reports. When a surge of reports comes in, the system doesn’t check for truth or falsity — it suspends first, then waits for human review.</p><p name="3e4f" id="3e4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a blunt instrument. And in the hands of malicious actors, it becomes a censorship weapon.</p><p name="7f72" id="7f72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><br>---</p><p name="f77b" id="f77b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why Me?</p><p name="c35f" id="c35f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am a physicist. I am also a federally protected whistleblower. My writings expose truths about mathematics, about governance, about corruption, about information warfare.</p><p name="8e68" id="8e68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If my attackers could defeat me with evidence, they would. If they could disprove my physics, they would. If they could undermine my credibility through debate, they would.</p><p name="7ed1" id="7ed1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, they mass-report. They attempt to make me invisible, not because I am wrong, but because I am right.</p><p name="9940" id="9940" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><br>---</p><p name="9104" id="9104" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Chilling Effect</p><p name="4813" id="4813" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first sensation when you realize your work has vanished is not anger. It is terror. For a brief moment, you feel that everything you built — every word, every proof, every record — has been erased.</p><p name="dc35" id="dc35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is the true weapon of a suspension: not the hiding of content, but the psychological impact on the author. The chill down the spine. The moment of doubt.</p><p name="be6c" id="be6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here is the truth they cannot erase: my work still exists. The mathematics are still there. The signed, dated physical copies still exist. The tweets and public posts still exist. And every article written with the help of AI is reproducible. The historical record cannot be deleted by pressing a “Report” button.</p><p name="38a3" id="38a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You cannot mass-report a physicist out of existence.</p><p name="7453" id="7453" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><br>---</p><p name="ffd2" id="ffd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Streisand Effect</p><p name="97da" id="97da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What has actually happened is the opposite of what my attackers intended. By trying to erase me, they have only proved my significance. By trying to silence me, they have amplified my voice.</p><p name="3e6a" id="3e6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every attempt to suppress truth becomes its own admission of fear. Every takedown is proof of impact. Every chill becomes a spark.</p><p name="1a52" id="1a52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Medium is now faced with a choice: remain a neutral platform that upholds free expression, or allow itself to be a pawn in international harassment against a whistleblower. I do not believe Medium wants to be complicit. But until they restore my account, that is the reality.</p><p name="4a75" id="4a75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><br>---</p><p name="f389" id="f389" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Day They Tried to Erase Me</p><p name="1abe" id="1abe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So yes — for a few hours, I felt that chill. I felt the weight of silence pressing in. But I also felt clarity.</p><p name="69b3" id="69b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They cannot erase the physics. They cannot erase the truth. They cannot erase the record.</p><p name="e4f2" id="e4f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They can only reveal themselves as people so afraid of what I’ve written that they must hide it, even temporarily.</p><p name="4095" id="4095" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The day they tried to erase me is the day they proved I am unerasable.</p><p name="c6d7" id="c6d7" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
