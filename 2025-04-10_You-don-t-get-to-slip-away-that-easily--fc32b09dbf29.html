Nobody likes what you write, especially the women you abuse. Yes, they can and will speak out for themselves, and I hope they do, but.. this is not about not liking what you write, this is about directly responding to what you like to write. This is your feedback, and if you didn&#39;t want feedback on garbage, don&#39;t write garbage. You are poisoning people&#39;s minds and we have every right to do everything in our power to let people know about it. So, no I will be reading everything that you write, and continue to respond. I can even read what you write from another account if you choose to block mine. Or, you can choose to not write filth about human beings that show you to be an adolescent abuser. Is your partner okay? Asking for the people who are concerned about your partner. Is she free to move about? Does she wear sunglasses during the daytime but not because of the glare of the Sun? I am now requesting that you tell the world that your partner is available for an interview without you present.</p></div></div></section>
