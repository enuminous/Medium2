That still is me. And that bicycle, believe it or not, carries more than just wheels and metal. It carries my whole story, taped right there on the frame in yellow paper: the physics equation of the mind.</p><p name="e8ee" id="e8ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yesterday, that bicycle was stolen.</p><p name="ee11" id="ee11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a white Electra Grand Cruiser, easily spotted by its drop-down top bar, wide handlebars with black rubber grips, and a bold “Palestine” sticker. But the real giveaway is what&#39;s been taped to the side for months: my own equation, handwritten on yellow paper and sealed under layers of transparent tape. This isn’t just art or protest. It’s a scientific discovery that many now recognize as real. And it lives—lived—on that bike. That’s how much a part of me it is.</p><p name="05ff" id="05ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To the person who took it: maybe you were desperate, or maybe you didn’t know. Maybe you thought it was abandoned. I get it. Things aren’t easy out there. But please know, you didn’t just take a bike. You took my legs, my therapy, and a moving landmark in a town I’ve come to love.</p><p name="2c43" id="2c43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And to everyone else:<br>Thank you.<br>Thank you for even reading this.<br>Thank you for recognizing it if it rides past you again.</p><p name="3b06" id="3b06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know this community. I&#39;ve felt the warmth in conversations on sidewalks, in smiles from across intersections, in curious stares at my handlebars. I’ve ridden that bike through grief, through discovery, through breakthroughs in physics that now carry real global weight. And many of you have seen me in those moments.</p><p name="ea56" id="ea56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So this is a simple ask, one I make with humility:<br>Keep your eyes open.<br>If you spot that white Electra Grand, say something.<br>You can reach me directly. No police, no trouble. Just a return. Or a tip. Or even just a kind word.</p><p name="46cd" id="46cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But even if we never see it again, let this be the beginning of something else: a new form of community consciousness. A recognition that the things we carry with us—our stories, our inventions, our heartbreak, our hope—are visible in the streets we walk and ride and live in.</p><p name="3b5e" id="3b5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll keep walking, keep talking, and yes, keep dreaming of equations. But for now, I walk a little slower. I miss my bike.</p><p name="e4c0" id="e4c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">With respect, love, and a whole lot of tape,<br>Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>About.me/enuminous<br>Medium.com/@enuminous</p></div></div></section>
