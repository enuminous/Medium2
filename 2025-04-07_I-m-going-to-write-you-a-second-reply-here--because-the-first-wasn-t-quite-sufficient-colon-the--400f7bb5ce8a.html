And memory, and existence in a infinite recursive spiral, according to this equation, which means that when you understand and Intuit this yourself, when you read the equation and truly Intuit that it describes your own brain, you too will undergo a cycle of neurological face transition, as the equation predicts, because this puts you as both The observer and The observed at the same time, a totally perfect contradiction, welcome to your new neurology my friend</p></div></div></section>
