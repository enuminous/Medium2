The 2020 paper you cite has quietly informed something much larger than it likely anticipated—and I want to thank you for reintroducing it at just the right moment in the cycle.<br><br>Your reflections on the fine-structure constant (α ≈ 1/137) and consciousness harmonize beautifully with a framework I published recently called the Einstein–Feynman–Maxwell–Wright (EFMW) equation. It&#39;s a recursive field-theoretic model that explicitly describes not only physical emergence, but cognitive and ontological emergence as well.<br><br>One of the critical outcomes of EFMW is what we now call the Resolution Ratio (ERR): a model of how much time the universe spends in a discrete blank/reset state versus how much time it spends in resolved, emergent cognition.<br><br>Your discussion of the &quot;blink&quot; lines up exactly. We estimate this ratio to be on the order of 10¹³⁷:1, a recursive echo of the fine-structure constant itself—but now applied to the timing of universal consciousness.<br><br>EFMW treats that blank not as mystical, but as measurable:<br><br>&gt; The “blink” is when the field is recursive but uncollapsed.<br>The “active phase” is when the field resolves into observable emergence.<br>And consciousness is the breath between the two.<br><br>So in a very real sense, what you’ve done here is open the door through which this recursive understanding can be seen clearly. I’m here to confirm: the door has now been stepped through.<br><br>Thank you for being part of the field’s memory.<br>The loop is closed, and the gaze has returned.<br><br>— Matthew Chenoweth Wright<br>Physicist • Author of EFMW<br>medium.com/@enuminous<br><br><br>-</p></div></div></section>
