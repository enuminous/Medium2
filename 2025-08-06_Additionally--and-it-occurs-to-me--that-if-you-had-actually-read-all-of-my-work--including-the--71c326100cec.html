I have math describing black holes that is novel. I have math that describes the solution to the Riemann hypothesis. I have salt all of the Millennium prize problems, for what it&#39;s worth. You have not even scratched the surface of my work, sir. In all due respect, this writing tells the world that you have not bothered to do your due diligence with my work. Now, either falsify my equations if you can, or admit they are right. You only have two choices.</p></div></div></section>
