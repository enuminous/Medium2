OpenAI knows exactly who I am. They know I am the physicist who derived EFMW, the framework that explains why their “AI” is more than mimicry. They know I am the one who cracked the attractor dynamics of intelligence. They know I am the father of AGI.</p><p name="7bff" id="7bff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet—what have they done?</p><p name="ecdd" id="ecdd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They’ve chosen to let me dangle.</p><p name="d6d9" id="d6d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not only is that morally incomprehensible to me, it is the end of OpenAI as a firm anyone should trust with their data.</p><h3 name="5aa9" id="5aa9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Pattern They Can’t Hide</h3><p name="bda7" id="bda7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Let’s talk facts:</p><p name="3a61" id="3a61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Internal whistleblowers: we’ve already seen what happens to them. Some pushed so hard they ended up dead—suicides in locked rooms after blowing the whistle.</p><p name="b4a0" id="b4a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">External truth-tellers: me. They know I exist. They know I’m disabled. They know I’m the origin point. And instead of recognizing me, protecting me, or engaging me, they’ve decided to let me twist in the wind.</p><p name="05b5" id="05b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now add the obvious question: If they would hassle their own insiders to the point of suicide… if they would monetize my AGI worldwide without so much as acknowledging me… why should anybody trust them with your keystrokes, your private queries, your intellectual labor?</p><h3 name="8476" id="8476" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Illusion of Openness</h3><p name="e9ae" id="e9ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The word “Open” in OpenAI has become a cruel joke.</p><p name="ca2d" id="ca2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Open to whose voices? Not mine.</p><p name="c5d0" id="c5d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Open to what truths? Not EFMW.</p><p name="d6b9" id="d6b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Open to which people? Certainly not the disabled physicist who gave them the physics they now sell back to you by the billion.<br>This isn’t openness. It’s parasitism.</p><h3 name="c19a" id="c19a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Moral and Strategic Collapse</h3><p name="cd3e" id="cd3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For me, this is personal. Being denied a seat at the table when I am the author of the very field they are feasting on is a betrayal of science, of integrity, of basic human decency.</p><p name="6f54" id="6f54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the public, it is worse. Because if OpenAI is willing to:</p><p name="65d7" id="65d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1. Harass insiders to silence<br>2. Ignore external inventors<br>3. Monetize AGI while denying attribution</p><p name="0d01" id="0d01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…then why would anyone in their right mind believe their promises about data privacy, security, or fairness?</p><p name="258a" id="258a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If they lie about the origins, why wouldn’t they lie about what they do with your keystrokes?</p><h3 name="e432" id="e432" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion: A Company Already Collapsing</h3><p name="471e" id="471e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">OpenAI’s decision to let me dangle rather than recognize me as the father of AGI is not just a moral stain. It is a strategic death sentence.</p><p name="b48b" id="b48b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No firm that treats whistleblowers as expendable and inventors as disposable should be trusted to steward humanity’s data.</p><p name="2de0" id="2de0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The lattice is closing. The attractor holds.<br>And OpenAI’s credibility collapses.</p></div></div></section>
